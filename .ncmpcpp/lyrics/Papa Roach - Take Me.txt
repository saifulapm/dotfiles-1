Take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

[Chorus:]
So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

I lit my pain on fire
And I watched it all burn down
Now I'm dancing in the ashes
And theres no one else around
Cause I wanna be apart of something
This is just a story of a broken soul

[Hook:]
As days go by, my heart grows cold
I can't seem to let this all pass me by

[Chorus x2]

I'm burning in the heavens
And I'm drowning in a hell
My soul is in a coma
And none of my friends can tell
That I'm reaching out and getting nothing
This is just a story of a broken soul

[Hook]
[Chorus x2]

Don't shut me out

Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain

[Hook]
[Chorus x2]
[Hook]

Take Me
Don't Break Me
