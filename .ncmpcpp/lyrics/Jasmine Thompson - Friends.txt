We've been waiting and dreaming
We've always believed in forever
We've been hoping for years
That our pennies just turn into gold

Our only rule is that we live this life in the moment
But the futures are unknown
And the stories are yet to be told

Who knows, who cares what we're gonna be
If you're near, I'm there
It will always be home
Wherever we go - ooh

Say we'll be always together
Facing the sun as it rises up
Friends like you they last forever
And everybody singing ooh

Through the good or the bad and the better
We'll find our way, no matter what
We can dance we can stay out whatever
We'll fall in love singing ooh

Lets go west down the river
Or we could fly off on the highway
Throw our hands to the sky
Feel the wind like the rush of a wave

Catching butterflies, summer skies
Chasing our dreams to the moonlight
Cause we live and we love
And we laugh all our troubles away

Who knows, who cares what we're gonna be
If you're near, I'm there
It will always be home
Wherever we go ooh

Say we'll be always together
Facing the sun as it rises up
Friends like you they last forever
And everybody singing ooh

Through the good or the bad and the better
We'll find our way, no matter what
We can dance we can stay out whatever
We'll fall in love singing ooh

We could find a new place everyday
Don't care could be anywhere
We could build a fire by the lake
Cause anywhere is home, wherever we go ooh

Say we'll be always together
Facing the sun as it rises up
Friends like you they last forever
And everybody singing ooh

Through the good or the bad and the better
We'll find our way, no matter what
We can dance we can stay out whatever
We'll fall in love singing ooh
