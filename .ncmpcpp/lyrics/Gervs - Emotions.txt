You left me here to bleed out
All my blood is dry now
Covered in the color of the roses I bought you

Love is getting harder
I don't even bother
Shielding off the dirt, you're trying to dig me a grave

I try so hard to focus
You never even noticed
Everything I did for you
The anger I just kept in
My emotions were neglected
You didn't seem affected

Can you hear my voice
Or am I talking to a wall?
When you touch my skin
I can't feel it anymore

I'm running from the cold now
Oxygen is low now
Holding my feelings
I will never unfold

I'm losing all connection
Drowning in emotion
Letting is harder than you'll ever imagine

I try so hard to focus
You never even noticed
Everything I did for you
The anger I just kept in
My emotions were neglected
You didn't seem affected

Can you hear my voice
Or am I talking to a wall?
When you touch my skin
I can't feel it anymore

Emotion, emotion, emotion
