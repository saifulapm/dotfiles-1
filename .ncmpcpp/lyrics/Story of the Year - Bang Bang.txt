I wish that I could pretend
There's a place for me with the skeletons
Where I never have to hide
And the God above that tucks me in at night
But this is more like the end
Of a fucked up dream
Where I swear to myself I'd make it out alive
But before the angel could save my soul
I let her go

Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
One last kiss before I go (woah! woah!)
Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
One last kiss before I go (woah! woah!)

Now it's hard for me to keep smiling
While I'm begging for a knife
To carve away the thoughts of you and I
At least I can say
That I've learned some thing about giving up
And fighting for my life
Give me one last try and I'll get it right
(Say goodbye)

Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
One last kiss before I go (woah! woah!)
Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
One last kiss before I go (woah! woah!)

This canyon in between
Where I stand in my defeat
At least that's what I keep telling myself, telling myself
But the smile is short and sweet
I'm pulling out my teeth
I don't know how you know me so well, you know me so well
But when heaven's doors are closed
And there's hell beneath my toes
Promise me you'll give me one last kiss before I

Go!
One last kiss before I
Go! Go! Go!
One last kiss before I

Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
Hey hey!
And I'm fighting for my life!

Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
One last kiss before I go (woah! woah!)
Bang bang!
A bullet to my head
Hey hey!
Alive amongst the dead
One last kiss before I go (woah! woah!)

One last kiss before I go!
