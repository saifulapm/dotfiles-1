I just want revenge

Feel like someone's up to something
Betrayal in the air, I'm losing my mind
Just another knife in my back
Pull 'em out and watch my pain pour out
Always the ones you hold the closest
Always the ones you thought you trusted
No memory is gonna save you
No memory is worth the pain you caused

And I just want revenge
And a little bit more
And a little bit more
Lower your defense
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I am confident
With a little bit more
With a little bit more
I'll hit you with some sense
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I just want revenge

It might be petty but I don't care
It's not pretty but I'm not scared
You might say I'm overreacting
You always try to, always try to
You minimize the hurt you gave me
You minimize the pain that plagues me
Oh your demise is round the corner
No compromise, I'm taking over now

And I just want revenge
And a little bit more
And a little bit more
Lower your defense
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I am confident
With a little bit more
With a little bit more
I'll hit you with some sense
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I just want revenge

And I just want revenge
And a little bit more
And a little bit more
Lower your defense
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I am confident
With a little bit more
With a little bit more
I'll hit you with some sense
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I just want revenge
