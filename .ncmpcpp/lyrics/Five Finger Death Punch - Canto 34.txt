Round 1!
I swear to god I'd do it for fun
Just a dead man walkin' with a double barrel shotgun
Ain't a single ****er left to fear
See their lips moving' but I don't wanna hear
Show down (I ain't backing down from anybody)
Throw down (If I don't get some space)
Lay down (not in this life or another)
It's a nightmare (and it's not going away)

All I wanted was your honesty
Something more than this
Something more than me (more than me)
Death can take me if I can't be free
I am not like you, I'm a dying breed

Round 2!
Something you just don't wanna do
Go dancin' with the devil, unless your wearing my shoes
You got nerve, and I'll give ya that
Watch the world crumble while you sit on your ***!
Wake up (get your head together ************)
Straight up (before it's too late)
Stand up (nothing ever lasts forever)
Corrupt (and that's how it's gonna stay)

All I wanted was your honesty
Something more than this
Something more than me (more than me)
Death can take me if I can't be free
I am not like you, I'm a dying breed

All I wanted was your honesty
Something more than this
Something more than me (more than me)
Death can take me if I can't be free
I am not like you, I'm a dying breed
