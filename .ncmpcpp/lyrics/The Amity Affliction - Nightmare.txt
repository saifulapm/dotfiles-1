Are you living in a nightmare,
One that eats away your soul?
Does it leave you feeling empty,
Does it leave you feeling cold?
So you’re living in a nightmare
Well I’m living in one too
But I’m trying to prevent the storm
From bearing down on you

There are rats on every corner
There are serpents in the street
You know hell is coming for you -
Now there’s demons at your feet

When it all comes crashing down
And you don’t know where to go
Yeah you think the world is ending?
That’s a feeling that I know

Don’t be so quick to shut me out
I know it’s hard to face the day
But we can make it out together
Feel your nightmare slip away

Are you living in a nightmare,
One that eats away your soul?
Does it leave you feeling empty,
Does it leave you feeling cold?
So you’re living in a nightmare
Well I’m living in one too
But I’m trying to prevent the storm
From bearing down on you

I swear the storms are building faster
Swear the walls are caving in
But every time we start to falter
I know we can look within

When it all comes crashing down
And you don’t know where to go
Yeah you think the world is ending?
But I swear you’re not alone

Don’t be so quick to shut me out
I know it’s hard to face the day
But we can make it out together
Feel your nightmares slip away

Are you living in a nightmare,
One that eats away your soul?
Does it leave you feeling empty,
Does it leave you feeling cold?
So you’re living in a nightmare
Well I’m living in one too
But I’m trying to prevent the storm
From bearing down on you

You know love still fills your lungs
We breathe the same air
Love still fills your lungs
You know love still fills your lungs
We breathe the same air
And you are far too fucking young
To let the weight of the world destroy you
So one more night, breathe for me
I know the deep blue’s stretched between us
But you are never too far from me

Are you living in a nightmare,
Does it leave you feeling empty,
Does it leave you feeling cold?
So you’re living in a nightmare
Well I’m living in one too
But I’m trying to prevent the storm
From bearing down on you

Are you living in a nightmare?
Are you living in a nightmare?
