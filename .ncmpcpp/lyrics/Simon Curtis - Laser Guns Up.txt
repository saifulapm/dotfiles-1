Got your attention, now I'm gonna keep it, better listen up
This one's for the people who've been told they're never good enough
The little girls and boys who dream of what they wanna be
The little girls and boys who grow up into you and me

But you and me we've got a little secret in our playbook
A little something that'll really shake the game up
Something for the people who don't think that you deserve
Now you've got a super weapon that can take over the Earth

Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it in the air
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it on stun
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh

We're all just trying to make it, but making it big is so hard
Before you take a bullet, think you'd better get a bodyguard
Build some walls of steel around yourself before you go
Cause rejection is the name of the game, but do you listen?
No
You struggle and you fight and
Yeah, you're probably gonna bleed a lot
So get your bloody ass up to the mark
And then you take your shot
You're only gonna get one chance to make the world aware
Of who you are and what you do so you had better come prepared

Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it in the air
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it on stun
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh

The name is S-I-M-O-N, the game is P-O-P

There's a gun for me
There's a gun for you
Better shoot to kill
You know what to do
Break a line, do the time
Need to find a clip
Two fingers to the face
That's how you make a hit

There's a gun for me, there's a gun for you
Better shoot to kill, you know what to do
I did anything and everything
No matter what the cost did
To me, but it left me feeling
Broken and accosted
I'll put a flame above your head
Just like the Pentecost did
Now hands where I can see em'
Cause you all are going hostage

I've done this before
Now get your face on the floor
And put your motherfucking lasers up
And say you want more
Because I'm
S I M O N
Because I'm
S I M O N
Because I'm
S I M O N

Put em up

Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it in the air
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it on stun
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh

Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
You take your laser gun and you put it in the air
And you fire to the sky like
Eh eh eh
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
Put your guns up
Put your laser guns up
To the sky like
Eh eh eh
