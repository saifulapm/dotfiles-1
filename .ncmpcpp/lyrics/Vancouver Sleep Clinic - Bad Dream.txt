You made me feel like it's a bad dream
Just a world that I imagined
The truth wouldn't sink in
But my chest started sinking

And I wished it was a bad dream
I'd wake up like nothing happened
And everything
Would be alright

You were a beautiful distraction
Gave reality my absence
Consumed all my hours
Filled my lungs up with flowers

You left so many that I can't breathe
I feel heavy, I felt empty
But everything
Will be alright

You will hear me say, goodbye my love
You will hear me say, goodbye my love

It's like I'm living in a bad dream
Close my eyelids but I can't sleep
And times that I savored
Became time that was wasted

I wished I could go backwards
Before love was just nostalgic
And everything
Would be alright

You will hear me say, goodbye my love
You will hear me say, goodbye my love

You will hear me say, I'll be on my way
You will hear me say, I'll be on my way
Any day now
