I shoulda known it wouldn't happen 'cus it wasn't right
I shoulda known it cus it happens every god damned time
Almost thought we coulda been something, almost thought we could have tried, but
It didn't happen so I need you to get out my life

But the other night I had you in my head, called you on the phone
Want you stealing my time even though I said I wanna be alone
Oh and I should know this could never work, oh, this could never end well
Know it's only human but I never learn, I want you for myself

I can take the fall: the pain, the pleasure
And you can take it all, for worse, or better
But oh, what if we're wrong? What if we're not all that we thought?
Then we won't make it long, but hey, I guess that's us

We couldn't help it but you know that doesn't make it right
You say I'm selfish but I know you felt the same inside
Everybody says it's all okay, everybody says we're fine but
Guess someone else is what you need to make you feel alright

But tomorrow night I'll probly call a cab, show up at your door
Love you in the night time, leave you in your bed, cold and wanting more
Oh and I should know this could never work, oh, this could never end well
Know it's only human, but I never learn, I need you for myself

I can take the fall: the pain, the pleasure
And you can take it all, for worse, or better
But oh, what if we're wrong? What if we're not all that we thought?
Then we won't make it long, but hey, I guess that's us

I can take the fall: the pain, the pleasure
And you can take it all, for worse, or better
But oh, what if we're wrong? What if we're not all that we thought?
Then we won't make it long, but hey, I guess that's love
