And some will take the high road, I will go low
There's nothing left behind me, set fire to it all
The fury will fade and the images too
A world without you, that's what I need to do

So part of me wants you to fade
Wherever you used to be
And now I won't remember

You, you
You don't get to say goodbye, erasing the pain inside
You, you
Eternal side of my mind, a jolt and then you'll die

Will I want to go back, will I ever try
Maybe this is the end, my bitter paradise

So part of me wants you to fade
Wherever you used to be
And now I won't remember

You, you
You don't get to say goodbye, erasing the pain inside
You, you
Eternal side of my mind, a jolt and then you'll die

I wanted to run, wanted to live my life by the gun
She left me stunned, but I'm still alive
I wanted to fly, wanted to feel the sun and the sky
I flew too close, but ooh

You, you
You don't get to say goodbye, erasing the pain inside
You, you
Eternal side of my mind, a jolt and then you'll die
