I had a think about my oldest friends
Now I know longer hang with them
And I can't wait to be home again

I had a year that nearly sent me off the edge
I feel like a five, I can't pretend
But if I get my shit together this year
Maybe I'll be a ten

Help myself a little better 'cause
It's getting tiring
And I can't wait for the summer
No, I'm gonna need a moment

I did it again, I did it again
No control over my emotions
One year on and I still can't focus

I did it again, yeah I did it, I did it again
12 rounds in, fightin' solo
But nobody wins when it ends

We'll be placin' memories in frames
Invitin' people 'round to stay
And always owning up to things, to things

'Cause after all I guess it all depends upon
The people you choose and where you're from
If so, I've been so lucky so far, it's outrageous
I won't complain (No)
Give my self a little credit since I dealt with all the pain
Yeah, I turned superhero, I'm comin' in Bruce Wayne

Yeah, I did it again, I did it again
But this time I took control
And turned my shit 'round
Sometimes you gotta cut a bitch out

I'm livin' again, yeah I'm livin', I'm livin', again
Yeah
Whoa, yeah

Now I'm safe and sound where I belong
It took all my strength to carry on
And though it's still hard work to find the words
I'm still gonna write this fucking song
'Cause after all I guess it all depends upon
The people you choose and where you're from
