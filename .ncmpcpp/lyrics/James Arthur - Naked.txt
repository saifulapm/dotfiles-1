Hey, you there
Can we take it to the next level
Baby, do you dare?
Don't be scared
'Cause if you can say the words
I don't know why I should care

'Cause here I am
I'm giving all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up
Yeah, I'm right here
I'm tryna make it clear
That getting half of you, just ain't enough

I'm not gonna wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)

Hey, get out
I've got nothing left to give
And you give me nothing now
Read my mouth
If you ever want me back
Then your walls need breaking down

'Cause here I am
I'm giving all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up
(all you ever do yeah)
Yeah, I'm right here
I'm tryna make it clear
That getting half of you, just ain't enough

I'm not gonna wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)

I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything

I'm not gonna wait until you're gone
'Cause you pretended you don't need anyone
Can't you see that I'm naked
(Naked, naked)
See that I'm naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked
(Naked, naked)
I'm standing
I'm standing here
