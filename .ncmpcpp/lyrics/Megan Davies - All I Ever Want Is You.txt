He's been my King
Since we were sixteen
We want the same things
We dream the same dreams
Alright

I got it all
'Cause she is the one
Her mom calls me 'love'
Her dad calls me 'son'
Alright

And I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na

He belongs to me

Kisses like cream
Her walk is so mean
And every jaw drop
When she's in those jeans
Alright

I don't exist
If I don't have him
The sun doesn't shine
The world doesn't turn
Alright

And I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na

She knows, she knows
That I've never let her down before
And he knows, he knows
That I'm never gonna let another take his love from me now

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na

She belongs to me

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na

He belongs to me
