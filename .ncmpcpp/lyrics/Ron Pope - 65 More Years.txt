I will always love you
As simple as that sounds
I'd swim an ocean deep as your blue eyes
To close the distance that's between us right now

In 65 more years
When your body is tired and weary from age
And you don't got the strength to walk the stairs up to our room
I'll pick you up and carry you to bed with me

'Cause I will always love you
As simple as that sounds
Watch the streetlights turn from green to red and back again
Dumbstruck by the grace I will do without

'Cause I will always love you
Ain't got too much more to say
I will love you, I will love you, I will love you
Wherever you lay your head
Your heart stays here with me
With me
