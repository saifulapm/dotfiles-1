(So) bring ya vibe over here here here...
Throw it up the air air air...
Run my hands through ya hair hair hair...
Give ya that love cause ya oh so rare...
You look better over here than ya do over there... and I don't wanna share (huh)
You don't let a good thing go to waste
So I'll take the lipstick off that face

[Chorus:]
If your name was Lucy I'd put Lucy in her Lucy fur
My god what in the devil bring the animal right out of her
If your name was Lucy I'd put Lucy in her Lucy fur
My god what in the devil bring the animal right out of her
She said she ain't Lucy
I said not yet
She said she ain't Lucy

I fix you up something up real real tall
Things are looking up we should take it all off
You remind me why the stars don't fall
Swear I love you like your last name is Ball
I'll take you to the lair if we make it past the stairs... I don't wanna share ya
You don't let a good thing go to waste
So I take the lipstick off that face
I don't wanna share ya...

[Chorus]

Baby I'm just trying to get to know ya
So bite you're tongue before I a bite it for ya
[x2]

[Chorus]
