My heart is weak
Tear it down piece by piece
Leave me to think
Deep in my structure, I think I still love her
But I need some sleep
You've taken my breath away
Now I want to breathe
'Cause I cannot see, what you can see
So easily

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side and you pulled them to freedom
I kept your secrets and I thought that you would do the same

Leave me in peace
Caught in my memories
Lost underneath
Deep in my structure, I feel a rupture
From where she should be
You've taken my breath from me
Now I want to breathe
'Cause I cannot see, what you can see
So easily

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side and you pulled them to freedom
They know my secrets and won't let me go, won't let me go
I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side and you pulled them to freedom
I kept your secrets and I thought that you would do the same

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side and you pulled them to freedom
They know my secrets and won't let me go, won't let me go
I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side and you pulled them to freedom
I kept your secrets and I thought that you would do the same
