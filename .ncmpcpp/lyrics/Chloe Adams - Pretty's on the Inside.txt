I don't look like her
She's in all the magazines
So much prettier than me
You don't know it hurts
Staring at my iPhone screen
Watching others live their dream

But mama, she said to me
(Mama she said)
One day my love.. you'll see

Pretty's on the inside
See it in your own eyes
Look a little closer in the mirror tonight
Pretty's on the inside
But I can't tell my own mind
Maybe if I look a little harder, I'll find
That pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside

I don't like myself
But maybe it's all in my head
And I am not the words I've said
These images they sell
Maybe none of it is real
And I could love the way I feel

Cuz mama, she said to me..
(Mama she said)
One day I swear you'll see

Pretty's on the inside
See it in your own eyes
Look a little closer in the mirror tonight
The pretty's on the inside
But I can't tell my own mind
Maybe if I look a little harder, I'll find
That pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside

Cuz mama, she said to me..
Don't live in jealousy
And mama she said to me
You'll see it eventually

The pretty's on the inside
See it in your own eyes
Look a little closer in the mirror tonight
The pretty's on the inside
But I can't tell my own mind
Maybe if I look a little harder, I'll find
The pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
Pretty's on the inside
