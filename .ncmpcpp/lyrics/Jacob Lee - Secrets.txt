I know
We belong here
I'm searching for a reason to come home
And I won't
Let our hearts grow old
Until we're all alone
And all we have is all we'll ever need

I know we aren't
Where we said we'd be
When we were 17
But I feel safe here
Lay with me
The stars watch us tonight

I'll stay
For as long as you will know
I'm searching for a reason to call home
And I won't
Let our hearts collide
Until the moment's right
And all we are is all we'll ever be

I know we aren't
Where we said we'd be
When we were 17
But I feel safe here
Lay with me
The stars watch us tonight
And that's okay with me

Tell me all your secrets
Till the sun comes up
Know that I will keep them
Til' we are old enough
Show me all your pictures
Of how we fell in love
So we can go back to the start

Lay, my, heart
By your side tonight
We, seem, to
Believe in a better life
Place, my, hand
By your heart tonight
Feel, your, heart
Beat as we shut our eyes

Tell me all your secrets
Till the sun comes up
Know that I will keep them
Til' we are old enough
Show me all your pictures
Of how we fell in love
So we can go back to the start

Tell me all your secrets
Till the sun comes up
Know that I will keep them
Til' we are old enough
Show me all your pictures
Of how we fell in love
So we can go back to the start

I know we aren't
Where we said we'd be
When we were 17
But I feel safe here
Lay with me
The stars watch us tonight
