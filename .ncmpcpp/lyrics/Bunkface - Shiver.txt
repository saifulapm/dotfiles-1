I was a young boy
I didn't knew myself
I kept on running away

But everything now
Is everything i knew
I finally understand

*I fell in love with a
Microphone giving all my
Love to all the
Young blood feeling it too

**You make me shiver
You make me feel good
And you're the only one for me
You make shiver
You really make feel alive
And you're the only one for me

I was a young boy
I didn't have a clue
What to say what to do
Now i am older
I see a clear view
I got my rythm in you

Repeat * & **

For the rest of my life
Im running out of time
So im not gonna waste it
And for the rest of my life
Im running out of time
