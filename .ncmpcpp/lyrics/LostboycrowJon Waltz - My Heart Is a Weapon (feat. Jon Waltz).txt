My heart is a weapon
I gave it to you, I'm defenseless
Your kiss is a question
Double-take, does it taste like deception?

Is my touch not enough
Cause we stay up all night, all night?
No more drugs, but the rush
Leaves us like alright, alright

[Lostboycrow:]
Ain't got no time, no time
Ain't got no time, no time, no
Ain't got no time, no time, no
Unless your love is mine
Love, love
Mine
Love, love
Ain't got no... time
Ain't got no time, no, ah
Ain't got no
Ain't got no time, no, ah

My heart is a weapon
But your eyes could teach me a lesson
I look away for a second
And turn around till your mouth's second-guessing

Is my touch not enough
Cause we stay up all night, all night?
No more drugs, but the rush
Leaves us like alright, alright

[Lostboycrow & Jon Waltz:]
Ain't got no time, no time
Ain't got no time, no time
Ain't got no time, no time (I ain't got no time, baby)
Unless your love is mine
Love, love
Mine
Love, love
Ain't got no time, no time
We fuck all night, all night
We ain't got no time, no time
Time, no

[Jon Waltz:]
Tattoo on your left thigh
And I wonder what's your sex like
Because your mind's amazing
No, I'm not the best guy
But I think that we should just try
Girl, we could be somebody
Don't know what your past like
But I met you in a past life
You're not just anybody
There's gotta be a catch, right?
Cause I know you know
I know you know
You don't ask for too much, you're busy, I get it
But with me, you're with it, I miss you, girl
We be like the same thing, so why are you far?
Just open me your heart and give me your all

[Lostboycrow (Jon Waltz):]
Ooh, we ain't got no, ain't got no
Ooh, ain't got no
Unless your love is mine
Oh, oh
Unless your love is mine
No, no
Unless your love is mine
(I miss you, girl)
Mine
(I miss you, girl)
