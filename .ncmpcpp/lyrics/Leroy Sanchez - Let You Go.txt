We're not supposed to be alone
Why couldn't we get along?
Seems like pride always gets in the way
Can't do love, too much pain
I keep replaying the day you
Walked right out the door
And never accounted for my heart
And we both end up with scars

No, don't say you're sorry
Tryin' to tell me you love me
Don't get emotional, I already let you go
Cause you cut me too deep
And I ain't losing sleep
But one thing that you should know
I already let you go

I picture you wakin' up
Thinkin' bout it then makin' up
But nothin' at all
Not even a single call
I waited for days, days turned to weeks
And now I see you comin' round
But I won't let it bring me down, no, no

Well I guess in love and war
You win, you lose, you forget why you fought
And we both end up with scars

No, don't say you're sorry
Tryin' to tell me you love me
Don't get emotional, I already let you go
Cause you cut me too deep
And I ain't losing sleep
But one thing that you should know
I already let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go!

No, don't say you're sorry
Tryin' to tell me you love me
Don't get emotional, I already let you go
Cause you cut me too deep
And I ain't losing sleep
But one thing that you should know
I already let you go

Don't say you're sorry
Tryin' to tell me you love me
Don't get emotional, I already let you go
Cause you cut me too deep
And I ain't losing sleep
But one thing that you should know
I already let you go
