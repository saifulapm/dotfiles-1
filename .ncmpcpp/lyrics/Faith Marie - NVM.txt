Will they understand?
It's the question of a lifetime
Tryna find the right words
But what if they don't care?
Never mind
Dealt with it myself
Hiding in the bathroom
Wearing long sleeve shirts
Scared of what I might do
Never mind

No one seems to hear you till you're loud
Then they call you crazy
Then they call you crazy
Quietly I battle with myself
Days are getting hazy
Days are getting hazy
No one seems to notice when you're down
Unless you are bleeding
Unless you are bleeding
But sometimes the worst wounds are the ones
Are the ones you can't see
Are the ones you can't see
Never mind

Do they understand?
I'm begging for an ally
Think I'm just confused
Blow it off it's nothing new
Never mind
Little do they know
The murder of my right brain
It still has me grieving
Take these pills for sleeping
My world is turning black and white

No one seems to hear you till you're loud
Then they call you crazy
Then they call you crazy
Quietly I battle with myself
Days are getting hazy
Days are getting hazy
No one seems to notice when you're down
Unless you are bleeding
Unless you are bleeding
But sometimes the worst wounds are the ones
Are the ones you can't see
Are the ones you can't see

Never mind
Never mind

If life is but a dream flowing gently down the stream
Then I'm caught in the rapids leaking boats and broken things
Merrily merrily swimming towards the shore
A voice they said was harmless only threw me overboard
If life is but a dream
Nothing but a dream
Then I just wanna smile wanna smile in my sleep
Merrily merrily nightmares all the time
No one hears the screams
Just wave as I float by

Row row row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream
Row row row your boat gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream
