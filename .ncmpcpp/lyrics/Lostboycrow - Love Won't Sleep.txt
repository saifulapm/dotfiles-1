Put out these fires in my headspace
Cause I'm wide awake
Why am I awake?
The city sits below and we take shots at the moon
I wanna give it to you
(I wanna give it to you)

Tell me is it so bad
Cause it hurts like that when I think about it
We're both cynics now
It kills me, but I'd die for you anyway
Yeah, so scared when it hurts right, there's no way around it
In too deep now and we'll never be the same

My love won't sleep
My little ghost queen
Keep haunting me
Wearing my heart beneath those rolled up sleeves
Where my eyes can't see
Tell me what my dreams could mean
When my love won't sleep, love won't sleep
(Sleep, sleep)
(Sleep)

The daylight fades in different shades, babe
Your hair's the same, I can't escape (uhuu)
Pull me into your darkness, I'll stay
Too high to drown this mountain now
But I could feel your every wave

Is it so bad
Cause it hurts like that when I think about it
We're both cynics now and
It kills me, but I'd die for you anyway (die for you)
Are you so sad cause it feels like that when you're not around me
And I'm singing loud
Cause I know that you're awake

My love won't sleep
My little ghost queen, keep haunting me
Wearing my heart beneath those rolled up sleeves
Where my eyes can't see
Tell me what my dreams could mean
When my love won't sleep, love won't sleep (ah)
In my love, in my love
Won't sleep
In my love, in my love
In my love
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
In my love won't sleep
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Won't sleep
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Ghost, ghost, ghost
Won't sleep
