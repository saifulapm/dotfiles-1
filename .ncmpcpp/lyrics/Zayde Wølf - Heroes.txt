I can hear the lost crying
I can hear the truth hiding
The shadows are calling us out
I see the fear rising
Yeah but my hope is burning
The shadows are calling us out

We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
When there is no light
We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
But we'll rise above
We are heroes

It's feeling like the sun's hiding
But we're gonna keep moving, surviving
No we won't go quiet tonight
Stand up and shout louder
Oh no we won't be silent
The shadows are calling us out

We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
When there is no light
We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
But we'll rise above
We are heroes

When the night is starless
Only we can spark it
Light it up in the darkness
When the night is starless
Only we can spark it
Light it up in the darkness

We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
When there is no light
We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
But we'll rise above
We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
When there is no light
We are heroes
Heroes in the darkest times
But we'll rise above
We are heroes

We are heroes
