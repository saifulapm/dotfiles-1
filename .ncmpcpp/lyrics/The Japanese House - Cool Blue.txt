How can you wait in the wash of the rain?
You're soaked to your feet
Still, you said you'd wait for me

And these days, they grow so old
And I'll never show
I thought they knew
I'm fickle and slow, and I'll never do

This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue
Honey, keep it
Whenever you start to leave

I was up every night
A phantom of myself, beside
She rattled my bones
(Don't you think I fit the part?)
I'll never grow
It's all that I know

These things, they slow
Maybe, they should

[x2]
This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue heart you're keeping
Whenever you start to leave
