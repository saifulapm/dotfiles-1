If I fall asleep, please don't let me dream
I keep on wishing that I'll forget those awful things I've seen

I'm afraid to fall asleep
Dream catcher, won't you save me?
From the terror in my mind

You wouldn't believe, you wouldn't believe
The way that violence has been glorified
I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe
That I was taking lives in record time
My ears are plagued with the cries of my enemies
I heard their cries, but mine silently died

'Cause there's no one I can turn to
I've got a question and nobody's got the answer
So I'm asking one last time
Ohh, is there a way, is there a way to tell the difference in between
A dream and a memory?
I've got these memories of enemies
That dwell on me perpetually

I'm afraid to fall asleep
Dream catcher, won't you save me?
From the terror in my mind

The ways of the world have evolved in
Opposition to the common man
A sovereign state of mind evoked the end
You sure did make a killing, but I'm the last man standing

'Cause there's no one I can turn to
I've got a question and nobody's got the answer
So I'm asking one last time
Ohh, is there a way, is there a way to tell the difference in between
A dream and a memory?
I've got these memories of enemies
That dwell on me perpetually

I'm the only one awake
Even though I can stand on my own two feet
I stand alone without a soul to keep me company

And there's no one I can turn to
Dream catcher, won't you save me?
And there's no one I can turn to
Dream catcher, won't you save me?
And there's no one I can turn to
Dream catcher, won't you save me?

'Cause there's no one I can turn to
Dream catcher, won't you save me?
