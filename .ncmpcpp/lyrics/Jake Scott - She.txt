She's the light in a dark room
When she smiles with her eyes
It'll hold you
And you know in a moment
You'll never walk away
She's never been one to hold back
If there's something on her mind
You're gonna know that
And you're gonna wanna listen
To everything she'll say

She's a bullet that's about to fire
She's the steady that'll keep you sane
If loves a fool then I'm a liar
I know she's the only way

She sees colors that I can't see and
She knows me even when I don't
She knows where she goes
I will go because I'm home
Where she

She's the wildwood leaves in autumn
She's the look toward home you forgot
When she's on her side
You're never letting go
She has the power to save you
The only one who's got
Enough of you to break you
When she fights with fire
She wraps around your soul

Ive never heard this touch before
The kind that taught me
What my eyes are for
Every piece of her I just want more
She's the one I can't ignore
