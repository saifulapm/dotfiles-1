Careful as I write her name
On the corner of the page
Make it look like it was her all along, and I
Put the paper in my bag
As I am walking back to class
And the notes I wrote, that took me so long

She doesn't notice me
She just smiles and says
"Thank you for the
Trigonometry"
'Cause that's all it meant to her
But I spent

22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
(Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
Doing Annabelle's homework

Careful as I walk away
So she can't see it on my face
How I look and now I am feeling so bad
I am, disappointed in my self
'Cause I know love is not for sale
Oh, my mother raised me better than that

She doesn't notice me
She just smiles and says
"Thank you for the
Geography"
'Cause that's all it meant to her
But I spent

22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
(Ohh, Ohh, Ohh)
Doing Annabelle's homework

I'm alive, you don't know I'm here
Just circling around in your atmosphere, yeah
I'm alive, you don't know I'm here
Just circling around, just circling

22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
(Ohh, Ohh)
Now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
