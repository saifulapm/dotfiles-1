With a bold and sudden calling
Western Revolution's starting
Let our hearts be open to it pacifist nation
Riding on a penny-farthing, It's the flag of our sun rising
Warding evil spirits like an ICBM

On the train tracks, running along the line
Let us move forward, don't look behind
Boys and girls becoming like samurai
Just like those from our previous life

Thousands of cherry blossoms dwindling in the light
Though I can't hear your voice, keep what I say in mind
This bouquet that surrounds
Is iron poison, see?
Looking down at us from that big guillotine

Darkness has just engulfed the universe we know
The lament that you sing can't reach ears anymore
We are still far away from reaching clear blue skies
Go ahead, keep shooting, with that ray gun, fight!

[Instrumental]

Veterans who've trained through struggles are now officers in battle
Here and there, we see the harlots in procession
This one, that one, doesn't matter, every single person gathers
March on to our saintly deaths now!
1, 2, 3, 4

Passing through the gates on the mountain peaks
Escaping this world, kill all the evil fiends
Surely this will end in a denouement
Among the crowds giving their applause

Thousands of cherry blossoms dwindling in the light
Though I can't hear your voice, keep what I say in mind
This bouquet that surrounds
Is iron poison, see?
Looking down at us from that big guillotine

Darkness has just engulfed the universe we know
The lament that you sing can't reach ears anymore
We are still far away from reaching peaks of hope
Go ahead, keep shooting, use the flashing bolt!

On the train tracks, running along the line
Let us move forward, don't look behind
Boys and girls becoming like samurai
Just like those from our previous life

Thousands of cherry blossoms dwindling in the light
Though I can't hear your voice, keep what I say in mind
That bouquet that surrounds
Is iron poison, see?
Leaping down to us from that big guillotine

Thousands of cherry blossoms dwindling in the light
Once your song can be heard, we'll dance with all our might
This bouquet that surrounds
Is iron poison, see?
Go ahead, keep shooting, with that ray gun, lead
