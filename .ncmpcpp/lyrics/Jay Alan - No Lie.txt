I’ll be the bad guy,
I’ll take the black eye,
When I walk out,
You can slam the door,
I’ll be the S.O.B,
If that’s what you need from me,
So you don’t have to love me anymore.

When you and our friends talk,
Make it all my fault,
Tell ‘em I’m rotten to the core,
I’ll let it all slide,
Get ‘em all on your side,
So you don’t have to love me anymore.

I will keep,
All those memories, of the good times.
Yeah, there were some good times.
So when you think,
Of you and me,
They won’t even cross your mind.

If the wine you’re drinkin’,
Leads you to thinkin’,
That you want what we had before,
Girl you can call me,
I’ll let it ring and ring,
So you don’t have to love me anymore.

Yeah, I will keep,
All those memories, of the good times.
Yeah, there were some good times.
So when you think,
Of you and me,
They won’t even cross your mind.

If you need me to make you cry,
I don’t want to but I’ll try,
So you don’t have to love me anymore.
