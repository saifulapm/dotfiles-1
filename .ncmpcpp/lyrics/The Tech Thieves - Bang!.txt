Look what you did to me
I lost my soul
The storm got a hold of me
It won't let go
And I've been putting out fires
While you left me here to burn
Somehow the insanity
Became my home

Something's calling
I can hear the sound
The sky is falling
Watch it hit the ground

Bang!

Won't fade into blackness
Won't fall apart
You live for the sadness
And broken hearts
You got a thirst for pain and you're coming back for more
Found peace in the madness
I'm on my own

Something's calling
I can hear the sound
The sky is falling
Watch it hit the ground

Bang!

Something's calling
I can hear the sound
The sky is falling
Watch it hit the ground

Bang!
