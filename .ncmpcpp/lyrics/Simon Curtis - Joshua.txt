I'm so tired of people always saying that I'm a good person
Cause I'm not
If they could only see what was in my head

Little boy has come into his own
He's gotta make them big decisions cause he's grown
He's gonna get a rude awakening if he don't realize
Who really loves him
Who lies
Do you ever stop to wonder if they love you?
When you look into the mirror do you see the truth?
Or do the voices in your head still got you confused?
Do they make you wanna say

I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
Who I am who I am who I am
I'm not a good boy

I wonder if you ever stop and think
About whatever happened to me
Did you ever maybe think that I was victimized
By those who said they loved me?
They lied
Do you ever stop to wonder if I loved you?
When you look into the mirror do you see the truth?
Or do the voices in your head still got you confused?
Do they make you wanna say

I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
Who I am who I am who I am
I'm not a good boy

Do you know that you broke me down?
But I'm letting it go
I'm breaking it down
For all that I know
You've broken it down
I just want you to know
You can turn it around

I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
Who I am who I am who I am
I'm not a good boy

I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
I'm not who you think I am
Who I am who I am who I am
I'm not a good boy

This isn't about you
It's about me
