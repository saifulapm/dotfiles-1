Hold on tight
Don't let go of me
Love is all there is
Love is all we need

Darling don't be scared
I can feel your pain
Even heroes fall
Even heroes fail

You're always running
Like the world is on fire
But can you see me coming
[?] down through the wire

I will be a shooting star
When you look up in the night
Burning through the atmosphere
Brighter than the city lights
I will be a satellite
You don't ought to say goodbye
I can hear your SOS
I can see you from the sky

I can hear your SOS

I'm coming, coming
I'm coming, coming

I will be a shooting star
When you look up in the night
Burning through the atmosphere
Brighter than the city lights
I will be a satellite
You don't ought to say goodbye
I can hear your SOS
I can see you from the sky

I can hear your SOS

SOS
I'm coming, coming, coming...
