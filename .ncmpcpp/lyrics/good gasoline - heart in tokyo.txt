If I had to drown myself
in gasoline
would you carry the match for me?

If I had to kill them all
to purify
would you bury the dead with me?

Strange how it feels, to fly alone
when the pilot's down
Close to the end, we won't atone
when the pilot's down

If I let the fever grow
and sicken you
would you spread the disease with me?

Sabotage the only cure
to keep us pure
and infect everyone we see

Strange how it feels, to fly alone
when the pilot's down
Close to the end, we won't atone
When the pilot's down

Watching it all come apart
So we can begin, to be new again
Taking a blade to the heart
So we can begin, to be new again
To be new again [x4]

How does it feel, the corves are set
death is in the net
Follow my lead, prepare yourself
for what is next

If I had the key to all
that's nuclear
would you turn on the switch with me?

With poison in the atmosphere,
would you stay down here
on the ground for a thousand years?

Watching it all come apart
So we can begin to be new again
Taking a blade to the heart
So we can begin to be new again
[x2]
To be new again [x8]
