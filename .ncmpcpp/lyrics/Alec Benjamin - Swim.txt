I've been falling much more deep
Than I wanna
I've been wishing I could breathe
Underwater
I hold my breath
I can't see what comes next
I don't know when
I'll see dry land again

Another 40 days I'm lost at sea
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Hoping that your heart will rescue me
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim

I've been drowning in these sheets
Feeling lonely
Wishing you were here with me
Every morning
Over my head
The tide comes rolling in
I don't know when
I'll see dry land again

Another 40 days I'm lost at sea
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Hoping that your heart will rescue me
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim

I will never get over you

Another 40 days I'm lost at sea
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Hoping that your heart will rescue me
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim

I will never get over you
