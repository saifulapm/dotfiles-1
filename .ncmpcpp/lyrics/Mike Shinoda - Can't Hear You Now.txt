You can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now

Yeah, yeah
Run, run it back
Tell 'em what I'm coming at
I was on that bullshit
Then now I'm done with that
Scared of what I didn't want
Scared of what I wanted and
Thought that I was finished
But I hardly had begun in fact
I'm a beast
I'm a monster
A savage
And any other metaphor
The culture can imagine
And I gotta caption for anybody asking
That is I'm feeling fucking fantastic

Some days it doesn't take much to bring me down
Some days I'm struggling for control
Some days it doesn't take much to bring me down
But right now I'm floating above it all

So you can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now

Yeah, yeah
Come, come again
Feel it when it's flooding in
Woke up knowing I don't have to be numb again
Starting line
Scratched out
I don't have to run again
Give a fucks maxxed out
Tell 'em that I'm not coming in
I'm not present on the payroll
And you can tell me how I should do it
Cause you say so
But I'm not dancing to the rhythm
You replay no
Cause I'm already half a million miles away though, they know

Some days it doesn't take much to bring me down
Some days I'm struggling for control
Some days it doesn't take much to bring me down
But right now I'm floating above it all

So you can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now

And I waited too long
I listened too much
You said what can't be unheard
I'm drawing a line
Enough is enough
I let you have your last words

So you can call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now

So you can't call till your voice is running out
But I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now
I'm somewhere far away where you can't bring me down
So I can't hear you now
I can't hear you now
