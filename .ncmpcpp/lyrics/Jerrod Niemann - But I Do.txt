Every street's got a crowded place
Every week's got a Friday night
Every crowd's got a pretty face
That oughtta get you off my mind

Everybody's got good intentions
Everybody's got bad advice
Everybody's just got to mention
How I gotta get over your goodbye

I can't let go (Go, go...)
And I can't give up your ghost

Why can't I
Think without drinking
Drink without thinking
Stop the not sleeping
Missing you
Creeping up on me
I shouldn't love you
(Shouldn't love you)
Why can't I
Need to not want you
Want to not need you
Close the damn door
And baby just leave
The memory of us
Collecting dust
I shouldn't love you
But I do

(But I do)

Why'd your kiss have to hit like whiskey
Why'd your hair have to fall like rain
Why'd you have to love me like crazy
Just to leave me all insane
And you're (so good)
So good (so good)
At getting me (so)
So hurt

Why can't I
Think without drinking
Drink without thinking
Stop the not sleeping
Missing you
Creeping up on me
I shouldn't love you
(I shouldn't love you)
Why can't I
Need to not want you
Want to not need you
Close the damn door
And baby just leave
The memory of us
Collecting dust
I shouldn't love you
(I shouldn't love you)
But I do

Oh but I do

I don't know what I thought we were
I don't know what I thought we had
I think maybe I thought we'd work
Yeah baby I thought we'd last

I don't know where you are
But I know anywhere I am
Sitting here with a jacked up heart

Why can't I
Think without drinking
Drink without thinking
Stop the not sleeping
Missing you
Creeping up on me
I shouldn't love you
(I shouldn't love you)
Why can't I
Need to not want you
Want to not need you
Close the damn door
And baby just leave
The memory of us
Collecting dust
I shouldn't love you
(I shouldn't love you)
(Shouldn't love you)
(But I do)
(Shouldn't love you)
I shouldn't keep letting you hurt me
But I do
(Shouldn't keep letting you hurt me)
(But I do)
(Shouldn't love you)
(But I do)
(Shouldn't love you)
Oh I shouldn't let you hurt me
Shouldn't let you hurt me (I shouldn't love you)
But I do
(But I do, But I do)
