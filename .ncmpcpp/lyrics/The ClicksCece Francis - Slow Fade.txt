[Verse 1]
There’s a dark idea in my mind
That I can’t deny
I keep telling you that I’m fine
Truth is, I lied
In the morning when I wake up
I sense a weakening will
And I wonder if It’s worth the fight
If I lost the thrill

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don’t know why, love will decide
What it want’s to do with me
How I wish I could take a sharp knife
And sever it clean

[Chorus]
Cause It’s just a slow fade
To black, as the night struggles to overtake
The light of better days
And it breaks my heart
As they try to pry me apart
Yrom youuuuuuuuuu
You you you you
Youuuuuuuuuu
You you you you

[Verse 2]
Today you told me that you loved me, and I know that you do
But the sound of your old hesitation always beats the truth
I know the ending to this story, to hear me now
If it's over please just tell me, don't drag it out

[Chorus]
Cause It’s just a slow fade
To black, as the night struggles to overtake
The light of better days
And it breaks my heart
As they try to pry me apart
Yrom youuuuuuuuuu
You you you you
Youuuuuuuuuu
You you you you

[Pre-Corus 2]
I don't know why love won't decide what it wants to do with me
If it's over this is gonna kill me
Just sever it clean

[Chorus]
Cause It’s just a slow fade
To black, as the night struggles to overtake
The light of better days
And it breaks my heart
As they try to pry me apart
Yrom youuuuuuuuuu
You you you you
Youuuuuuuuuu
