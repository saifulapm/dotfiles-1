Imma kill for the game, let me free you from your pain
Such a thrill, say my name girl I'm here to light your flame

(S!CK)
I need ya!
(S!CK)

Say, say my name, hit me up like whatcha say
Fly a paper paper plane, stopping darkness through my brain
Darlin' stay stay away, I don't need you in my brain
I'm riding wave after wave, give a fuck bout what you say
Imma go Kelly row, I can feel it in my bones
Baby go baby go, there's a demon in my soul

She don't know what's it's like and how much I need you
This is greater the warrants you never know

Imma kill for the game, let me free you from your pain
Such a thrill, say my name girl I'm here to light your flame

(S!CK)

Oh me oh me oh me oh me oh me oh my
Shut your lips you bitch you know that it can read your mind
All these women here they don't need to check the time
Whether I want you, I'm out of your mind
Oh you know I need you, like I need you in my life
There's no need to, need to know I need you my life
Am I an angel or a demon yeah decide
Am I an angel or a demon yeah decide
Am I an angel or a demon yeah decide
Am I an angel or a demon, demon, demon

Imma kill for the game let me free you from your pain
Such a thrill, say my name girl I'm here to light your flame
