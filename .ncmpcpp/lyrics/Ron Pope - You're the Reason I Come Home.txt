Watching you watching me
A fine way to fall asleep
The neighbors fight as we both rest our eyes

Hands in the fallen snow
Numb to the winter cold but we don't mind 'cause we'll get warm inside

You're the reason I come home
You're the reason I come home my love
You're the reason that when everything I know falls apart
You're the reason I come home

Paper doll silhouettes
Fingertips on window glass
The street's asleep so I breathe you in deep

The tragedies of chemistry
People dream of what you and me have found effortlessly

You're the reason I come home
You're the reason I come home my love
You're the reason that when everything I know falls apart
You're the reason I come home

And for a long time I remember saying prayers for something perfect
Saying prayers for someone kind
It's in my head
We're spinning circles down the avenues instead

You're the reason I come home
You're the reason I come home my love
You're the reason that when everything I know falls apart
You're the reason I come home
