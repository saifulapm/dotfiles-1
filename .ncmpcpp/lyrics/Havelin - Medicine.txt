VERSE 1
Oh I hope you know, I hope you know
That I was barely hanging on
When I first saw you I was pitiful
And I was losing every night

PRE-CHORUS
I asked if you might stay a while, oh stay a while (oh)
You said maybe, if your voice could make me smile, oh, make me smile (oh)
And I told you give me one chance
I don't deserve it give me this one chance

CHORUS
You're my medicine
You're my medicine

VERSE 2
Oh I hope you know, I hope you know
You pulled me up when I was down
You showed me love when I knew hopelessness
And breathing slowly, softer sounds

PRE-CHORUS
I asked if you might stay a while, oh stay a while (oh)
You said maybe, if your voice could make me smile, oh, make me smile (oh)
And I told you give me one chance
I don't deserve it give me this one chance

CHORUS
You're my medicine
You're my medicine

BRIDGE
And maybe I'll hold you
Maybe I'll look you in the eyes
And maybe I'd give it all
To see you smile
And maybe I'll hold you
Maybe I'll look you in the eyes
And maybe I'll tell you
That I love you tonight

CHORUS
You're my medicine
You're my medicine
You're my medicine (Oh I hope you know)
You're my medicine (Oh I hope you know)
You're my medicine (Oh I hope you know)
You're my medicine (Oh I hope you know)
