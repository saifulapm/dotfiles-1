Bobby threw a party
When his parents left town
He told a few people who told a few people
And word got around
It was a legendary evenin'
The whole place got trashed
It took all day Sunday and four of his buddies and twelve Glad bags
They got it all cleaned up, hauled it off in a truck
Before his parents got back
When they got home
He gave them a hug
And almost a heart attack

'Cause there was one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
His daddy threw a fit
And Bobby discovered
There ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can

Bobby had a car
His parents paid for
He'd take it out on dates
And drive it out to the lake
But he don't anymore
Now all of his friends
Are still going out
Not a care in the world
Just thinking about girls
And Bobby sittin' home and thinking about

That one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
That's all it took
You talk about a bummer
Ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can

It could've been worse
But that ain't the point
It could've been a rubber
Or a half-smoked joint
The hardest part is
It was almost fine
They drank a hundred beers
And cleaned up ninety-nine

But there was one beer can
Lying there on the floor
Right behind the sofa
You could see it from the door
His daddy had a fit
And Bobby discovered
There ain't nothing in this world can ruin your whole summer
Like one beer can
One beer can
