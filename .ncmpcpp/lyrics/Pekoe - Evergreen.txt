I know wisdom is one I greet after broken bones
Oh, I've skin to be stitched and the heal has something to show

Sometimes we learn too slow
And stumble through shadows of stories we've told
Let them come, let them go
These feelings are visitors that don't knock on doors

'Cause the light shines through the cracks in our hearts
onto the flaws in our souls
Where the evergreen grows
We'll never really need to ever really know,
'Cause these woods are safe place to go

A fire can burn me, but it cannot reap what I sow
'Cause these plant lives depend on my hopes
And I've much for a world full of evergreen trees

Oh, I know
It ain't simple to make like it's easy
As much as I'd like to believe
These feelings are visitors that don't knock on doors

'Cause the light shines through the cracks in our hearts
Onto the flaws in our souls
Where the evergreens grow
We'll never really need to ever really know
'Cause these woods are a place we call home

When we cry out our tears, it's a storm of our strength
Sending rain to these forests inside
And to face through this downpour is sunlight that counts for
Your heart's insight
Evergreen sleep well tonight

Tonight
