I like the way you talk
I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed
On my arm in ink, I swear

'Cause when the mornin' comes
I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around
You disappear

I wanna blow your mind
Just come with me, I swear
I'm gonna take you somewhere warm
You know "J'adore la mer"

'Cause when the mornin' comes
I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around
You disappear

(I got love for you, I got love for you)
Nice to meet ya
(I got love for you, I got love for you)
Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat you to a drink

I like the way you talk
I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed
On my arm in ink, I swear

'Cause when the mornin' comes
I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around
You disappear

(I got love for you, I got love for you)
Nice to meet ya
(I got love for you, I got love for you)

One minute you're there
The next one you're gone
Been waiting for you
All night, so come on

You know what I need
You know what I want
You know what I need now
You know what I need now

Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat you to a drink
Nice to meet ya, where ya been?
(I got love for you, I got love for you)
Let me treat you to a drink
(I got love for you, I got love for you)

Nice to meet ya
