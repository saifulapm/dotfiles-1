I'm sorry that I did this
The blood is on my hands
I stare at my reflection
I don't know who I am
Practice my confession
In case I take the stand
I'll say I learned my lesson
I'll be a better man

I'm packing up my things and
I'm wiping down the walls
I'm rinsing off my clothes and
I'm walking through the halls
I did it all for her
So I felt nothing at all
I don't know what she'll say
So I'll ask her when she calls

Would you love me more?
(Would you love me more?)
If I killed someone for you
Would you hold my hands?
(Would you hold my hands?)
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in?
(Would you turn me in?)
When they say I'm on the loose
Would you hide me when?
(Would you hide me when?)
My face is on the news
'Cause I killed someone for you

I hear the sirens coming
I see the flashing lights
I'm driving through the suburbs
Wearing my disguise
I show up at her door step
To look her in the eyes
I tell her that it's me
But she doesn't recognize
Can't you see I'm running
Said I need a place to hide
I've gotta ask you something
Could you please let me inside
Just let me explain
No, I wouldn't tell you lies
I know you'll understand
If you let me stay the night

Would you love me more?
(Would you love me more?)
If I killed someone for you
Would you hold my hands?
(Would you hold my hands?)
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in?
(Would you turn me in?)
When they say I'm on the loose
Would you hide me when?
(Would you hide me when?)
My face is on the news
'Cause I killed someone for you

You have to understand that
The one I killed is me
Changing what I was
For what you wanted me to be
I followed your direction
Did everything you asked
I hope it makes you happy
'Cause there's just no turning back

Would you love me more?
(Would you love me more?)
If I killed someone for you
Would you hold my hands?
(Would you hold my hands?)
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in?
(Would you turn me in?)
When they say I'm on the loose
Would you hide me when
(Would you hide me when)
My face is on the news
'Cause I killed someone for you, yeah
