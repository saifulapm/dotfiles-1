Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

I know you're clinging to the light of day
To tell you everything's A-okay
And medication don't do much
Yeah, it just numbs the brain
Guess you might say I'm a little intense
I'm on the bright side of being hellbent
So take it from me, you're not the only one
Who can't see straight (Can't see straight)

If you're ever in doubt
Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
But you gotta try
And I'm calling out...

Get up, get up
Get a move on
Get up, get up
What's taking so long?
Get up, get up
Get a move on
Stop stalling, I'm calling out
Get up, get up
Get a move on
Get up, get up
Ain't nothing wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me
Trust me

Everybody wants to sing their song
Some Marvin Gaye "What's Going On"
Ain't nothing normal when it comes to you and me
I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams

If you were ever in doubt
Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
But you gotta try
So, I'm calling out...

Get up, get up
Get a move on
Get up, get up
What's taking so long?
Get up, get up
Get a move on
Stop stalling, I'm calling out
Get up, get up
Get a move on
Get up, get up
Ain't nothing wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me

Yeah, I don't know why I never talk about it
I guess that's probably part of the problem
Yeah, sometimes you're wrong, sometimes you're right
I'm just gonna keep moving
Yeah, I'm just gonna keep moving
Today, tomorrow and the next

Get up, get up
Get a move on
Get up, get up
What's taking so long?
Get up, get up
Get a move on
Stop stalling, I'm calling out
Get up, get up
Get a move on
Get up, get up
Ain't nothing wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me

Get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up...
