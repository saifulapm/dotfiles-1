Yes, it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down
Why are we even trying to fight?
We've been here a million times

So I'm putting on my favorite dress
That you are gonna miss and never see again
Yes, it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down

So, I'ma buy a bottle of the best champagne
I'ma raise a glass up to myself in your name
And I'ma cry if I want to, it's my party without you
Here's to all the pain
Champagne

I would always scream your name
You were never fun to hate, no
Us and liquor never mixed, something I will never miss, no

So I'm putting on my favorite dress
That you are gonna miss and never see again
Yes, it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down

So, I'ma buy a bottle of the best champagne
I'ma raise a glass up to myself in your name
And I'ma cry if I want to, it's my party without you
Here's to all the pain
Champagne
Champagne

So I'm putting on my favorite dress
That you are gonna miss and never see again
Yes, it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down

So, I'ma buy a bottle of the best champagne
I'ma raise a glass up to myself in your name
And I'ma cry if I want to, it's my party without you
Here's to all the pain
Champagne
Here's to all the pain
Here's to all the pain
