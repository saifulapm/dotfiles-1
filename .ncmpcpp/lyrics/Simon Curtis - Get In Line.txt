Gonna tell you a little story
About a boy and his beats
And how he made an army
He took a long gaze up at the sky
And said "that's where I'm gonna be"
God I really need to be
Get me to the place where I can be free
To live how I want to
And let me do me
Gotta make a change immediately
Gonna do it on my own
Just watch and you'll see

I'll make myself an army out of people I love
Soldiers who will fight
Who will give it all up
And when the day comes
I will give it all away
To every single one of them
And what will they say?
They gonna give up their life
They gonna give it their all
They gonna give their everything
I'm gonna give up my life
I'm gonna give it my all
I'm gonna give my everything

Come on get in line with me
Throw your hands up for the fight of the century
Come on tear some shit up with me
Time to round up cause we're filling out the infantry
Eh
Are you gonna lead tell me what do you say?
If you're gonna sign better do it today
Are we gonna win?
Hell definitely
Eh
Get in line with me

Me

So this is the begging
The beginning of the end
The ending of the battle that I know we're gonna win
And though it's been a very long and difficult road
I've got a military full of people who I know

They gonna give up their life
They gonna give it their all
They gonna give their everything
I'm gonna give up my life
I'm gonna give it my all
I'm gonna give my everything

Come on get in line with me
Throw your hands up for the fight of the century
Come on tear some shit up with me
Time to round up cause we're filling out the infantry
Eh

If you're gonna sign better do it today
Are we gonna win?
Hell definitely
