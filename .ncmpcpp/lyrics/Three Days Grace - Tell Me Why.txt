How'd I wind up here again?
It's like I'm always getting blood on my hands
All it takes is one and I'm gone and a thousand 'til the end
How'd I wind up here again?

You take me to the edge
You push me too far
You watch me slip away
I'm holding on too hard

Tell me why!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me!
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
You take me to the edge
Push me too far
Watch me slip away
Holding on too hard
Tell me
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me?

How come nothing ever lasts?
It goes from good to bad to worse so fast
All it takes is one and I'm gone and you can't erase the past
How come nothing ever lasts?

You take me to the edge
You push me too far
You watch me slip away
Holding on too hard

Tell me why!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me!
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
You take me to the edge
Push me too far
Watch me slip away
Holding on too hard!
Tell me
Why?!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me?
(From me?)

Here I am alone again
Alone again
Here I am alone again

How come nothing ever lasts?
It goes from good to bad to worse so fast

Tell me why!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me!
Why?
Does everything that I love get taken away?
You take me to the edge
Push me too far
Watch me slip away
Holding on too hard!
Tell me
Why?!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
Tell me
Why?!
Does everything that I love get taken away?
From me?
