Wa, wa, wa

[Verse 1: Sam Lavagnino]
Haaaaa, I'm a muffin!
And it's muffin time
Who wants a muffin?
Please, I just wanna die
Hey, somebody kill me
Please, it's muffin time
Have you had a muffin today?
I wanna die, die, die

[Chorus: Sam Lavagnino]
Please, I wanna
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die
Please, I wanna
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die

[Verse 2: TomSka]
Die, potato, die!
I baked you a pie
Oh boy, what flavour?
Pie, pie, pie
Dad, I'm hungry!
Hi Hungry, I'm Dad
Why did you name me this way?
Why, why, why?
I'm gonna do an internet!
Well I'm gonna do a book
You're leavin' me?
I met a real man
Hey buddy, look!
Over here
Ha ha ha ha ha, now you're blind
You're gonna die
We're all gonna die
Ooh, a butterfly!
We're all gonna-

[Chorus: Sam Lavagnino & (TomSka)]
Die, die, die
Die, die, die (Pie, pie, pie)
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die (Why, why, why)
Please, I wanna
Die, die, die (Ooh, a butterfly)
Die, die, die (Hi, hi, hi)
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die

[Verse 3: TomSka]
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
Got your nose
Look out, he's got a nose!
Is this you? (Yes) Hello! (Hi!)
Here comes the airplane!
I like trains
Honey, I'm pregnant
I can explain
No! Don't jump
Okay, jump now
I have no idea how to breathe
Meow, meow, meow, I'm a cow
Hey, you got a license for that?
You'll never take me alive
Ha ha! They said I could never teach a llama to drive
No llama, no!

[Chorus: Sam Lavagnino & (TomSka)]
Die, die, die
Die, die, die (Pie, pie, pie)
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die (Why, why, why)
Please, I wanna
Die, die, die (No llama, no)
Die, die, die (Hi, hi, hi)
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die

[Bridge: Sarah Fullen Gregory]
Even though letting go feels right
I can't afford to say goodbye
You and I are bound together
Especially since cartoons live forever

[Chorus: Sam Lavagnino & (TomSka)]
Please, I wanna
Die, die, die
We're all gonna
Die, die, die (Pie, pie, pie)
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die (Why, why, why)
Please, I wanna
Die, die, die (No llama, no)
Die, die, die (Hi, hi, hi)
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die

[Outro: Sam Lavagnino]
It's muffin time
'Cause I wanna die, die, die
