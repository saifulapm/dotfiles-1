[Verse 1]
Running through the dark
Nowhere left to hide
Battle lines are drawn
Taste the smoke and fire

[Chorus]
([?])
This is warfare
This is warfare
This is warfare

[Verse 2]
We won't stop, until you fall
Cut you down, take it all
One by one, say goodbye
You can run, but you can't hide

[Chorus]
This is warfare
This is warfare
(This is warfare)
This is warfare

[Outro]
(This is warfare)
This is warfare
