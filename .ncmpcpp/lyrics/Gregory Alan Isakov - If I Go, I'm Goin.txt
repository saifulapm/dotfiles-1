This house
She's holding secrets
I got my change behind the bed

In a coffee can
I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave

And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go I'm goin shameless
I'll let my hunger take me there

This house
She's quite the talker
She creeks and moans
She keeps me up

And the photographs
Know I'm a liar
They just laugh as I burn her down

And I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go I'm goin on fire
Let my anger take me there

The shingles man they're shaking
The back door's burning through
This old house she's quite the keeper
Quite the keeper of you

I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
And if I go, I'm goin crazy
I'll let my darlin take me there
If I go, I'm goin crazy
I'll let my darlin take me there
