[Liam Payne:]
I don't wanna be broke when I d-i-e
Wanna be livin' it up in VIP
Tryna get in the club, they wanna see ID
Want me to wear nice shoes and a t-i-e

I've been workin' and gettin' by
But that ain't enough to satisfy
'Cause I got dreams for you and I
So I got money on my mind

So if you wanna stack it up, man, you gotta work for it
I-I-I-I-I-I
Ain't nobody gonna be doin' it for ya
I-I-I-I-I
I got dreams and I got time
But that ain't enough to get me by
So I stack it up, man, I gotta work for it
Yeah, I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I
I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I

I wanna flex hard like d-o-e
But right now my car need the m-o-t
And I can't give the valet no t-i-p
But like him, I got dreams and they're b-i-g

Tried to be a better guy
But that weren't enough to satisfy
I got dreams for you and I
I got money on my mind

So if you wanna stack it up, man, you gotta work for it
I-I-I-I-I-I
Ain't nobody gonna be doin' it for ya
I-I-I-I-I
I got dreams and I got time
But that ain't enough to get me by
So I stack it up, man, I gotta work for it
Yeah, I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I
I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I

[A Boogie Wit da Hoodie:]
Yeah, I know shit don't come free, you gotta work for it (Gotta work for it)
Lamborghini Urus, bought it when I first saw it (Skrrt, when I first saw it)
She caught me creepin', I had to buy her a purse for it (Purse for it)
I think if I ain't have money, I'd be the worst for her
And if I ain't have money, I woulda been lost or
The loudest ones was the brokest, I was a shit-talker
The loudest ones was the brokest and now we're strugglin' (Uh)
Girls call me friend, now they owe me, that money comin' in (That money comin' in)
Saint Laurent fiend, I put it in Louis luggages (Yeah, yeah)
Took her to Celine, bought her a couple luggages
Wasn't always sweet, Capri Suns for fifty cents (Yeah)
Now I just hate to reminisce (To reminisce)
