Isn't it time we thought of ways (oh baby)
'cause there is no time for us to waste (oh yeah oh)
So stop tryna wake me up
When all I want to do is to dream (yeah yeah)
Baby I don't got no time (no time)

Tick Tack gotta hurry up now
Get ready for the show of a lifetime [?]
And if all the light is on myself (oh yeah)

And the day I die
You'll know that I'm a genius
Say it one more time

You should know by now

And I'm a genius

And I won't be gone until you're dead (oh no)

Say it one more time

And I'm a genius

On the edge of sanity, visions of reality
Echoes of a time to come
Drowning in a wishing well, they have nothing left to sell
(But themselves)

I might as well embrace it (yeah)
And the day I die
You'll know that I'm a genius
Say it one more time
[?] (yeah)
You should know by now
So get on your knees and bow
'cause I'm a genius (ha)
(Oh yeah)

I'm a genius
