Before I met you
I never felt good enough
Before I let you in
I'd already given up
Left on read, no reply
Left me just, wonderin' why
Now I'm skeptical of love

So when you hold my hand
Do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me
Is it all of me or just one part?
So when you hold my hand
Do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me

Mama said there'd be boys like you
Tearin' my heart in two
Doin' what you do best
Takin' me for a ride
Tellin' me pretty little lies
But with you I can't resist

I'm terrified
But I'll never let you know
Social suicide
If I ever let it show
Everything feels just right
I fall in place, we fall in line
I'll never let you go

So when you hold my hand
Do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me
Is it all of me or just one part?
So when you hold my hand
Do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me
Is it all of me?
Yeah

Mama said there'd be boys like you
Tearin' my heart in two
Doin' what you do best
Takin' me for a ride
Tellin' me pretty little lies
But with you I can't resist

So when you hold me
(When you hold me)
Am I the only one?
Do you wanna know me?
(Do you wanna know me?)
Or is this all just for fun?

Mama said there'd be boys like you
Tearin' my heart in two
Doin' what you do best
Takin' me for a ride
Tellin' me pretty little lies
But with you I can't resist
No, no

Maybe mama doesn't always know best

Mama said there'd be boys like you
Too good to be true
Doin' what you do best
Takin' me for a ride
Tellin' me pretty little lies
But for you, for you, for you
I'll take that risk
