[Verse 1]
Talking to the mirror like I've seen him somewhere before
He said I look familiar, did we meet the other night?
Somebody once told me that there's two sides to life, what's yours?
I might have accidentally let the darkness eat the light
And that's why

[Pre-Chorus]
I prayed, I prayed, God sent me right to voicemail
It's like, all day my vanity is for sale
Take it away, my head is in my own hell

[Chorus]
Sing to me, I am not doing well
Getting tired of my own words
Sing to me 'cause I can't hear myself
Through the loudness of my own hurts
Call me selfish when I say this, say this
I'm kinda helpless, and I need you
Sing to me 'cause I'm not doing well

[Verse 2]
Somehow I got nominated as a king of sadness
Got so much I know that I could even feed the birds
And that's why

[Pre-Chorus]
I prayed, I prayed, God sent me right to voicemail
It's like, all day my vanity is for sale
Take it away, my head is in my own hell

[Chorus]
Sing to me, I am not doing well
Getting tired of my own words
Sing to me 'cause I can't hear myself
Through the loudness of my own hurts
Call me selfish when I say this, say this
I'm kinda helpless, and I need you
Sing to me 'cause I'm not doing well

[Bridge]
Somebody told me that there's two sides to this life
I think I might've chosen darkness over light

[Chorus]
Sing to me, I am not doing well
Getting tired of my own words
Sing to me 'cause I can't hear myself
Through the loudness of my own hurts
Call me selfish when I say this, say this
I'm kinda helpless, and I need you
Sing to me 'cause I'm not doing well

[Outro]
Sing to me, I am not doing well
Sing to me, I am not doing well
