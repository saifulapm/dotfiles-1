Tell me if I go, come back another day
Will you forgive me then? Will you let me stay?
I'm testing your patience, I'm fueling your pain
But I swear that I'm different, I'm willing to change

Will you forgive yourself
When you know what I've done?
Will you stop and reflect
Or continue to run?

So I can cower and weep
I can crumble and die
Or send you back to your hell
And get on with my life

Show me some proof that your black heart even beats
Show me your dreams, show me your fears and let me hear your screams
Pull your head from the clouds, come back down to your feet
Show me your dreams, show me your fears, show me your black heart beats
Show me your black heart beats

I know I've made my mistakes, I know what you'll say
I need to pull it together and seize the day
So if I come back tomorrow I swear I can change
Will you know me then? Will you know my face?

Will you forgive yourself
When you know what I've done?
Will you stop and reflect
Or continue to run?

So I can cower and weep
I can crumble and die
Or send you back to your hell
And get on with my life

Show me some proof that your black heart even beats
Show me your dreams, show me your fears, and let me hear your screams
Pull your head from the clouds, come back down to your feet
Show me your dreams, show me your fears, show me your black heart beats

I am inside you and you're inside of me
I am your laughter, your pain
Your love, your misery
I've written the letters
I've ground down my teeth
Now it's time to let go
So say farewell to me

I am inside you and you're inside of me
I am your misery

Death to misery

Show me some proof that your black heart even beats
Show me your dreams, show me your fears and let me hear your screams
Pull your head from the clouds, come back down to your feet
Show me your dreams, show me your fears, show me your black heart beats

Show me your black heart beats
Show me your black heart beats
Pull your head from the clouds, come back down to your feet
Show me your dreams, show me your fears, show me your black heart beats
