No I don't miss you yet
You're just a feeling I'd rather forget
So I pierce my skin and I buzz my hair
I'm going to Mexico

No I don't feel the same
Lack of chemicals in my brain
Won't keep me on so I pause and pray
I don't wanna feel the cold
So I'm going to Mexico

(Oh, Mexico)
Sounds so sweet but I'm going there alone
I tried to be myself but still, I've got some room to grow
I'm going to Mexico

And I won't miss you there
Weight of every word on my chest
So I curse my name and my fragile frame
Anywhere could feel like home (Anywhere)
But I'm going to Mexico

(Oh, Mexico)
Sounds so sweet but I'm going there alone
I tried to be myself but still, I've got some room to grow
I'm going to Mexico

(Mexico)
(Mexico)
(Mexico)

I'm going to Mexico
