You stole my heart of gold
After my silver soul
Can you dig any deeper now?
I gave you all I owned
Put you on a golden throne
But I'm a little stronger now

You cashed in all my promises
You know I'm too generous
Now I've learned to never help you out
Cause I'm done cleaning up your mess
Found myself in my regret
I've become a little stronger now
A little stronger now

You cashed in all my promises
You know I'm too generous
Now I've learned to never help you out
Cause I'm done cleaning up your mess
Found myself in my regret
I've become a little stronger now
A little stronger now...

You cashed in all my promises
You know I'm too generous
Now I've learned to never help you out
Cause I'm done cleaning up your mess
Found myself in my regret
I've become a little stronger now
A little stronger now
