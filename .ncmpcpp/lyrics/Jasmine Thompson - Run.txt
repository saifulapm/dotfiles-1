You are the wind in my sail
You are the spring in my step
You make me laugh you make me cry
And you make me forget

[Chorus]
So tell me when you run, I want to run with you
Tell me where you hide, I want to come to you
Tell me where you go, I want to go there too
Even if you fall I will go down with you
I will be the one who comes to rescue you
Tell me where you go cause I want to be there too

I hid my secrets in a box
I did exactly what you said
Now I’m feeling so much better
Cause you make me forget

[Chorus]
So tell me when you run, I want to run with you
Tell me where you hide, I want to come to you
Tell me where you go, I want to go there too
Even if you fall I will go down with you
I will be the one who comes to rescue you
Tell me where you go cause I want to be there too

So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run
So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run
So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run

You set the world on fire
But the flames are getting higher
So I stand beneath the waterfall
Yeah you set the world on fire
And the flames are getting brighter
But I don’t feel the heat at all

[Chorus]
So tell me when you run, I want to run with you
Tell me where you hide, I want to come to you
Tell me where you go, I want to go there too
Even if you fall I will go down with you
I will be the one who comes to rescue you
Tell me where you go cause I want to be there too

So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run
So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run
So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run
So tell me when you run
When you run, when you run, when you run, when you run
