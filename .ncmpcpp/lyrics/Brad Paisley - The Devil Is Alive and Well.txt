Same old story
Everyday
Hateful words
That we all use
So much anger
So much pain

I don't know
If you believe in Heaven
I don't know
If you believe in Hell
But I bet we can agree that the devil
Is alive and well
Alive and well

The darkest prison
To the largest Church
Sometimes for fortune
Sometimes for fame
It's ironic
That some of the worst things
Are done in God's name

I don't know
If you believe in Heaven
I don't know
If you believe in Hell
But I bet we can agree that the devil
Is alive and well
Alive and well

We can debate what's real, what's right, what's true
What's sent from above
All I know is I'd be weary of anything that isn't based in love
'Cause God is love

I don't know
If you believe in Heaven
I don't know
If you believe in Hell
But I bet we can agree that the devil
Is alive and well
Alive and well
