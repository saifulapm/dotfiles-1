If I had the money, let me tell you how it'd be,
I'd take over the country, everyone would bow to me,
Sit up in my palace, and baby you would be my queen,
We'd run this ship together, just you wait and see…

We'll be royalty [2x]
(I know, I know, I know)

I know we're broke right now,
Girl, I guarantee that I will work this out,
Yeah, see I've got this plan,
Are you in or out?
I need to understand
Trips to Rio, five star meal,
Girl, don't quit on me now,
If I gotta beg or steal, no big deal
Oh let me break it down

If I had the money, let me tell you how it'd be,
I'd take over the country, everyone would bow to me,
Sit up in my palace, and baby you would be my queen,

We'd run this ship together, just you wait and see…

We'll be royalty [4x]

So would you cover me,
If I gotta take out any enemy, yeah,
Cause it might get ugly,
Planning things that you don't wanna see

You're 'bout to party with stars, fancy cars,
Girl don't quit on me now,
If I've gotta rob or steal, no big deal
This is how we're going out

If I had the money, let me tell you how it'd be,
I'd take over the country, everyone would bow to me,
Sit up in my palace, and baby you would be my queen,

We'd run this ship together, just you wait and see…

We'll be royalty,
And I'll be the king baby,
We'll be sitting on a throne,
We'll be sitting on a throne, you and me, all alone,
Ain't no stopping us now

We'll be royalty,
So who d'you trust, girl its ride or die,
We'll be royalty
So pack your stuff, lets take this to the sky,
We'll be royalty,

So who d'you trust, girl its ride or die,
We'll be royalty
So pack your stuff, lets take this to the sky,
We'll be royalty
