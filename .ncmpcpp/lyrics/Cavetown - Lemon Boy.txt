There once was a bittersweet man and they called him, "Lemon Boy"
He was growing in my garden and I pulled him out by his hair like a weed
And like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So, I figured this time I might as well let him be

Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So, I got myself a citrus friend

But soon his bittersweet started to rub off on me
You'd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
I found out that my friends are more of the savoury type
And they weren't too keen on compromising with a nice lemon pie

So Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'll mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So, I got myself a citrus friend

But what if I run out of fertilizer
What if the clouds run out of rain
What if Lemon Boy won't grow no longer
What if beaches dry of sugarcane
Oh well

The whales start to beach themselves
The tortoise shells tear away from their spines
It happens all the time, it happens all the time

Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we'll get around wherever
Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we'll get around wherever
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
'Cause we're the bitterest boys in town
Yeah, we're the bitterest guys around
And I got myself a citrus friend
