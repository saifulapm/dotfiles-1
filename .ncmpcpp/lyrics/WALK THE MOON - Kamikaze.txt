Here in this room
I'm chasing down my demons, I can hear them breathing
But who knew
You would be my comfort, you could bring me healing

Well if my friend's gonna let me slide
How come you never left my side
Before I go make it last all night
While I slip into the great divide

(Woman!)
Stepping out of body, no matter what you call it
I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
Abandon all your logic, and put your money on it
I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll see you in another life
(Woman!)
Stepping out of body, you can tell everybody
Mama I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
(Oh I, oh I)

All is not lost
My veins are seething, I can feel the freedom
Let them talk
It's not about the crown, we could share the kingdom

Well if my friend's gonna let me slide
How come you never left my side
Before I go make it last all night
While I slip into the great divide

(Woman!)
Stepping out of body, no matter what you call it
I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
Abandon all your logic, and put your money on it
I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll see you in another life
(Woman!)
Stepping out of body, you can tell everybody
Mama I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
(Oh I, oh I)

If my friend's gonna let me slide
How come you never left my side
Before I go make it last all night
While I slip into the great divide

Stepping out of body, no matter how you call it
This is suicidal, honey, nothing you can do about it
Let me take the check with the reckless abandon on it
Just call me kamikaze

(Oh I, oh I)
Stepping out of body, no matter what you call it
I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
Abandon all your logic, and put your money on it
I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
Going down with my wings on fire
Guess I'll see you in another life
(Woman!)
Stepping out of body, you can tell everybody
Mama I'm a kamikaze (oh I, oh I)
