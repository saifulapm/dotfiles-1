There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in there ain't no letting go, letting go
Watch me turn your mind into my home

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
(Mind mind games until you lose control)
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo

Now that I'm in there's no letting go
And your emptiness begins
Once I grip onto your mind and soul
Your brightness starts to dim
Sin after sin you won't feel no more
You've lost your trust again
I know you wish you could let me know
That you're praying for an end

I can lie to you and tell you you can get me out your head
But I'm lovin' all the pain I'm causing you too much instead, baby

There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in there ain't no letting go, letting go
Watch me turn your mind into my home

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
(Mind mind games until you lose control)
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Bitch you think you know me
Holdin' back the dark force so long, call me Knobe
Thinkin I just gotta force this song when I get lonely
Take advantage say You'll hold me close but never show me

Someone told me you can only disguse and be pretend
The tears manifest sometimes my only friend
You'll never see them again they hide behind a mask
Thinkin' you're winnin' with all of your grinning but I got the last laugh...

I can lie to you and tell you I can't get you out my head
But I'm lovin' watching you think your controlling me instead, singing...

There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in there ain't no letting go, letting go
Watch me turn your mind into my home

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
(Mind mind games until you lose control)
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Mind mind games until you lose control...
