In silence and the darkness speaks again
Of a pain that never ends,
But it will cos I'm here still, I forgot
We can be stronger than sin
I used up every doubt to let you in
And this time out of light I see everything

It's how you make me breathe at night when I'm feeling small
How you break it down when I'm against the wall
Now I learn how a heart can ache
When the levee breaks and what it takes

For you and I
We fall apart to find the truth is our love survives
When every missing part of you makes me wanna cry
For you and I

Can you feel the pain drip, drip down like rain?

To every part of me that can't let go
In all forgiveness, I forgive it all
And I break if I ache, but then you know me

It's how you get me calm when the world's running up my veins
When the pressure is high, driving me insane
Carry me through when I fall again
How you stay the same I let it rain

For you and I
We fall apart to find the truth is our love survives
When every missing part of you makes me wanna cry
For you and I

Can you feel the pain drip, drip down like rain?

When I can see the moon it's crystal clear
A wish for everything can't disappear
And I will cos I'm here still just forgot

You and I
We fall apart to find the truth is our love survives
When every missing part of you makes me wanna cry
For you and I

Can you feel the pain drip, drip down like rain?
Wherever we are drip, drip just like rain
