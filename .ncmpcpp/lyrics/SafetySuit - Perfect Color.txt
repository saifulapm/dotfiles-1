Yellow nice to meet you
Do you know that you just blue my mind?
It was the perfect conversation, I think that I red about one time
And I told a white lie when I told you, I've never been green with envy you
You are the perfect color

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

To the misfits and the freaks
To the outcasts and the geeks
To the weird kids that don't care
Cause you feel like you're not there
To the ones who won't look in
To the mirror cause you're scared
Don't let the hater's hate become your own, oh, no, no

Now there's always gonna be someone who thinks art has no meaning
Who looks up at the Sistine Chapel and only sees a ceiling
But you, you you
Well you know what I would say to you?
You know what I would say to you?

Yellow nice to meet you
Do you know that you just blue my mind?
It was the perfect conversation, I think that I red about one time
And I told a white lie when I told you, I've never been green with envy you
You are the perfect color

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And in a perfect world
I'd get to say
It's just black and white
There's no room for grey
And there's a color scheme inside every heart
Ours won't be complete until we have yours
So yellow nice to meet you

Yellow nice to meet you
Do you know that you just blue my mind?
It was the perfect conversation, I think that I red about one time
And I told a white lie when I told you, I've never been green with envy you
You are the perfect color
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yellow nice to meet you
Do you know that you just blue my mind?
It was the perfect conversation, I think that I red about, I think that I red about one time
And I told a white lie when I told you, I've never been green with envy you
You're the perfect color
Ooh, ooh, ooh
