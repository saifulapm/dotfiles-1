Babe, did you take my heart?
Babe, did you take my heart?
But we fell apart, take me back to the start
But we fell apart, take me back to the start

Babe, this is all there is left
And your touch, was all that was felt
But we fell apart, take me back to the start
But we fell apart, take me back to the start

When you took my heart
When you took my heart
When you took my heart
When you took my heart
When you took my heart
