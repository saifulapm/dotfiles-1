Spent a few years being a fraud
Now it's my profession
Spent a few years hiding my flaws
But this is a confession
Spent a few years drowning in vodka
It was an obsession
By the end I was only a pawn
That was my progression

Now I don't care
But I don't care
Now I don't care
Anymore, anymore
Now I don't care
But I don't care
Now I don't care
Anymore, anymore

Spent a few years waiting in lines
Now they're waiting on me
Spent a few years nursing red eyes
Now you see the real me
Spent a few years spinning these lies
Hoping that they'd heal me
In the end I'm just chasing a high
I know you can feel me

Now I don't care
But I don't care
Now I don't care
Anymore, anymore
Now I don't care
But I don't care
Now I don't care
Anymore, anymore

Wait, did I see a sign?
Wait, do I need advice?
Hey, is this by design
Hey, that's fine
Wait, are you kidding me
All the falsehoods and misery
All the bullshit and memories
Killing me

Now I don't care
But I don't care
Now I don't care
Anymore, anymore
Now I don't care
But I don't care
Now I don't care
Anymore, anymore
