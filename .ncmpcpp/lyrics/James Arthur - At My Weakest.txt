It's a long night in a big crowd
Under these lights looking 'round for you
Yeah, I'm steppin' outside under moonlight
To get my head right, lookin' out for you, yeah

Could it be your eyes
Didn't know that I been
Waitin' and waitin' for you
When you're by my side
Everything's alright
I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you

Here I go, down that road
Again and again the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel
Some kind of way, do you feel the same?
Coz I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I fall for you

It's a long night in a big crowd
Under these lights looking 'round for you, mhm
You, you give me hope, rhyme and reason
Desire livin' this life only now for you
All for you

When you're by my side
Everything's alright
I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you

Oh here I go, down that road
Again and again the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel
Some kind of way, do you feel the same?
Coz and I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I fall for you

And now you've gone and got a hold of me
(Hold of me, hold of me)
Tell me what you're gonna do to me
(Do to me, do to me)
Oh and now you've gone and got your hands on me
(Touchin' me, touchin' me)
Tell me what you're gonna do

Here I go, down that road
Again and again the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel
Some kind of way, do you feel the same?
Coz I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I fall for you
