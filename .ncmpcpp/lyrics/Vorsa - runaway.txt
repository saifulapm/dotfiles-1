[Verse 1]
When did I become
This monster that I see
He stares right back at me
In the mirror
Does it get easier?
Or do you become numb?
After all the time
Of being broken

[Chorus]
I wanna run away
I wanna get away from here
I wanna run away
Find somewhere I can disappear

[Verse 2]
Iâ€™ll go into the dark
Just to feel something
Coasting with the wind
I see nothing
I've become good at hiding
And playing pretend
But I think it's time for a change
I think it's time for a change

[Chorus]
I wanna run away
I wanna get away from here
I wanna run away
Find somewhere I can disappear

[Bridge]
Choking on my words
Till I say goodbye
What do I say?
Nothing at all
When you think of me
Staring at the sky
Wondering if I'm looking back

[Chorus]
I wanna run away
I wanna get away from here
I wanna run away
Find somewhere I can disappear

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
