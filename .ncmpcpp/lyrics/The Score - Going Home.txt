You can't know up till you've been down
You can't take off tied to the ground
You can't live days scared of the night
And if it's dark don't mean there's no light

But in the silence, we can make a sound

Everyone wants
Everyone needs
Looking for something to believe
When we get close, everyone knows
Feels like we're going home
Everyone wants
Everyone dreams
In the end love is all we need
When we get close, everyone knows
Feels like we're going home

Feels like we're going home
Feels like we're going home

You can't know love till you know pain
You can't feel pride till you feel shame
Cause love's one thing you can't pretend
And desperation's not your friend

But in the silence, we can make a sound, oh

Everyone wants
Everyone needs
Looking for something to believe
When we get close, everyone knows
Feels like we're going home
Everyone wants
Everyone dreams
In the end love is all we need
When we get close, everyone knows
Feels like we're going home

Feels like we're going home
Feels like we're going home

(When we get close, everybody knows)
When we get close, everybody knows
(Feels like we're going home)
Feels like we're going home
(When we get close, everybody knows)
When we get close, everybody knows
(Feels like we're going home)
Feels like we're going home

Everyone wants
Everyone needs
Looking for something to believe
When we get close, everyone knows
Feels like we're going home
Everyone wants
Everyone dreams
In the end love is all we need
When we get close, everyone knows
Feels like we're going home

Feels like we're going home
Feels like we're going home
Feels like we're going home
Feels like we're going home
