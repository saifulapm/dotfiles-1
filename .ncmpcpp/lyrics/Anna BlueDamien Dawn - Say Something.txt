Baby I'm so tired
Of you keeping quiet
I feel the anger cutting slowly through my heart
And it burns like fire

I can sense the violence
Deep within your silence
Couldn't we just go back to before?
You put this love in danger
Treat me like a stranger
Nothing like the one I used to know

I wanna break the ice
But you keep acting cold
You gotta say something
Say something (Say something)
Can we make this right?
There's million things untold
You gotta say something
Say something (Say something)
Say something now

Say something now, yeah

Already left my guard down
You need to open up now
I feel the desperation crawling up my veins
And it makes my heart pound

I can sense the violence
Deep within your silence
Couldn't we just go back to before?
You put this love in danger
Treat me like a stranger
Nothing like the one I used to know

I wanna break the ice
But you keep acting cold
You gotta say something
Say something (Say something)
Can we make this right?
There's million things untold
You gotta say something
Say something (Say something)
Say something now

Tic tac, tic tac
Soon it's gonna be too late
Tic tac, tic tac
So baby don't you let me wait
Tic tac, tic tac
Everything could be alright
Tic tac, tic tac
But you're just letting time go by

I wanna break the ice
But you keep acting cold
You gotta say something
Say something (Say something)
Can we make this right?
There's million things untold
You gotta say something
Say something (Say something)
Say something now

Say something now
Say something now
