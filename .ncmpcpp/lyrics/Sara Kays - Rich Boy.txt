Purple lips, sad face
Going on a stupid date
Give him a chance her father would say
But she wouldn't want him no matter the day
Play nice, dress up
Don't forget your makeup
You really should impress him
Once you take your medicine

Ooh, daddy always had his ideas of being happy

Marry rich boy
Be a rich girl
Buy a big house
On top of the world
You'll be a princess
You'll be a queen
But her and her daddy they never agree

17, it's getting late
So listen to me and do as I say
Baby, you're not gonna make it on your own
Stand tall, suck in
Laugh to show you're into him
I heard he's got a million
So be a lady, not a friend

Ooh, daddy always had his ideas of being happy

Marry a rich boy
Be a rich girl
Buy a big house
On top of the world
You'll be a princess
You'll be a queen
But her and her daddy they never agree
Marry a rich boy
You'll need the money
So maybe one day you'll be worth something honey
Marry a rich boy

Can't you see he's what you need
To live in his society
It's only the reality
Baby

Marry a rich boy
Be a rich girl
Buy a big house
On top of the world
You'll be a princess
You'll be a queen
Bit her and her daddy they never agree
Marry a rich boy
You'll need the money
So maybe one day you'll be worth something honey
Marry a rich boy
