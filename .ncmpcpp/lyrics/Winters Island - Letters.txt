[Verse 1]
Well, I wrote you a song
But you say you want a symphony
I will take the light through the time
And the blades that break my soul
But then sadicity aside
And I'm not without you next to me
I will take the front to the line
And bring back the night before

[Chorus]
Light the fire
Let it burn on top of you (please stand back)
Breathe again, beneath the flames
I'm a man that can't be saved
Light the fire
Let it burn on top of you
Breathe again beneath the flames
I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man that can't be saved

[Verse 2]
Well maybe I was wrong
And perhaps you needed more from me
I can stand to fight all the time
But I can't seem to take the fall
Electricity aside
This is more than just a life for me
I can put our time on the line
And bring back the night before

[Chorus]
Light the fire
Let it burn on top of you
Breathe again beneath the flames
I'm a man that can't be saved
Light the fire
Let it burn on top of you
Breathe again beneath the flames
I'm a man, I'm a man
I'm a man that can't be saved

[Bridge]
From the flames, one man, you fall and you watch me rising
I know, I know
To be the man that walks beyond the fires
I know, I know

[Outro]
(Light 'em up, light 'em up) [x4]
Ares, Ares
Ares, Ares
Tear me down
See the man that I am now
And from the flames, Ares
