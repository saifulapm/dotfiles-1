Nightmare (mare, mare, mare)
There's no need for you to be scared (mare, mare, mare)
One taste of me nobody compares (mare, mare, mare)
I'll be the mark you can't erase, the demon tapping on your brain

I can show you all the places that you've never seen
I can take you where you're scared to go cause I've already been
We can keep it on the low, low, low
Your dirty secret no one knows
You know I know you wanna come with me

Chasing summer every night like we are in a dream
Yeah we're burning daylight, never wake cause that is when I leave
But while I stay I'll treat you right
I'll be your rush, I'll be your high
You'll never wanna leave my paradise

I'm only a nightmare
When you wake up and I'm not there
You'll fiend for me cause I don't play fair
I'll be the mark you can't erase, the demon tapping on your brain

Let me be your nightmare (mare, mare, mare)
There's no need for you to be scared (mare, mare, mare)
One taste of me nobody compares (mare, mare, mare)
I'll be the mark you can't erase, the demon tapping on your brain
Don't wanna wake up from this nightmare

Call me trouble, call me sin, call me a deadly vice
I will wake you up, set you on fire, I'll bring you to life
I know you never asked for it
Thought you were immune to it
Now I'm everything you never knew you needed

A wicked touch, a deadly mind, I'm not so patient, and I know
Exactly what I want to do, exactly what I want from you
Taste me while I load your gun
The game's roulette, let's have some fun
Pull the trigger maybe you won't wake up

I'm only a nightmare
When you wake up and I'm not there
You'll fiend for me cause I don't play fair
I'll be the mark you can't erase, the demon tapping on your brain

Let me be your night mare (mare, mare, mare)
There's no need for you to be scared (mare, mare, mare)
One taste of me nobody compares (mare, mare, mare)
I'll be the mark you can't erase, the demon tapping on your brain
Don't wanna wake up from this nightmare
