You said your name, I shook your hand
You tried to talk over the band
First night together turned into
Fistful of daisies at your door
We never made it off the porch
I couldn't keep my hands off you

I fell hard when you first kissed me
You made loving you so easy

Can't get you out of my heart, out of my head
Out of the shadows up over in my bed
Out of my bones, out of my soul
Out of the dark, girl, you make it so hard
To get you out my heart

Oh no, oh no
Don't know what I'm gonna do

I took a drive around the farm
I fell asleep under the stars
Got drunk as hell all by myself
I've been right through the Broadway bars
Spun a girl round in the dark
Everything I do just don't help

Everywhere I look I see you
Every breath I take I breathe you

Can't get you out of my heart, out of my head
Out of the shadows up over in my bed
Out of my bones, out of my soul
Out of the dark, girl, you make it so hard
To get you out my heart

Oh no, oh no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh no, oh no
Don't know what I'm gonna do

Stuck like a record spinning all around
Like a ghost that I can't get my arms around
Stuck like a record spinning all around, all around

Can't get you out of my heart, out of my head
Out of the shadows up over in my bed
Out of my bones, out of my soul
Out of the dark, girl, you make it so hard
To get you out my heart

Oh no, oh no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh no, oh no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
