Five am trains
And broken chains
I called you every afternoon

Forrest gump
And the hurricane trails
Though we never followed through

Do you have a 100 words for me?
Cause i have only three
You couldn't even sing for me
And i keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And i keep getting closer, to you

A lover's home
Is never shown
It's never known, to the common folk

You called me over
Said my name three times over
But you never looked me in the eyes

Do you have a 100 words for me?
Cause i have only three
You couldn't even sing for me
And i keep on writing these songs
Over and over
And i keep getting closer, to you

And i keep on writing these songs
Over and over
As i keep getting older, with you
