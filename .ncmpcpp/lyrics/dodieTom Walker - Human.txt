I wanna pick you up and scoop you out
I want the secrets your secrets haven't found

Paint me in trust
I'll be your best friend
Call me the one
This night just can't end
Oh oh

Will you share your soul with me?
Unzip your skin and let me have a see

Paint me in trust
I'll be your best friend
Call me the one
This night just can't end
Oh oh

Oh, I'm so human
We're just human

Lean for me, and I'll fall back
You'll fit so nicely, you'll keep me intact

Paint me in trust
I'll be your best friend
Call me the one
This night just can't end
Oh oh

I want to give you your grin
So tell me you can't bear a room that I'm not in

Paint me in trust
I'll be your best friend
Call me the one
This night just can't end
Oh oh

I'm so human
We're just human
