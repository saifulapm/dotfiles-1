Everybody says that every time we kiss it's like you bring me back to life
I'm trying not to listen, I don't know what this is, don't know if you're really mine
I forget my worries, moving with you body, music makes us lose control
Put your hands all over, kisses on my shoulder, is this real cause I don't know

Want you so bad, I can't sleep
And I can't eat
No I can't do without it
You come and you dance with me
Then go and leave
And I can't work you out

I ain't no fool
Am I waiting on a miracle?
I ain't no fool
Holding out for something beautiful
I'm playing it cool
I don't believe you when you say you're gonna call
So why's my heart just aching til you do
I ain't no fool
But I didn't know I'd fall for you
And I'm a fool for you

Ever since this happened, I been so distracted, trying not to lose my mind
Remembering each moment, watching in slow motion as your heart was stealing mine

Want you so bad, I can't sleep
And I can't eat
No I can't do without it
You come and you dance with me
Then go and leave
And I can't work you out

I ain't no fool
Am I waiting on a miracle?
I ain't no fool
Holding out for something beautiful
I'm playing it cool
I don't believe you when you say you're gonna call
So why's my heart just aching til you do
I ain't no fool
But I didn't know I'd fall for you
And I'm a fool for you

I got places to be
I got people to see
I got lovers all ready for loving me

I ain't no fool
Am I waiting on a miracle?
I ain't no fool
Holding out for something beautiful
I'm playing it cool
I don't believe you when you say you're gonna call
So why's my heart just aching til you do
I ain't no fool
But I didn't know I'd fall for you
And I'm a fool for you
