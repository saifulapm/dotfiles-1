Would you know what love is, if hate didn't exist?
You don't know 'bout a heartbreak, if the heart was always fixed
And I don't like a story, without a real good twist
You know, there's evil in this world we can't control
So let the punches roll
So let the punches roll
Yeah!

I don't like we've all been born afraid
Are we gonna make our great escape?
I feel alive, but I feel ashamed
Don't ask me why, there's blood to be shared or mouths to be fed

Would you know what love is, if hate didn't exist?

How 'bout a newsflash,
Ain't no such thing as a new past
Yeah we survive or we don't last
Yeah we survive or we don't last, no we don't last

Go ahead and rain on my parade
Yeah I'll be throwin' roses on my way
I feel alive, but I feel ashamed
Don't ask me why, there's blood to be shared or mouths to be fed
And what is it good for with nothing to fight for?
So let the punches roll
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
So let the punches roll
(Oh yeah)
