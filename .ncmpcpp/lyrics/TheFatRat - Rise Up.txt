When you feel it's hopeless
When you think that you lost, oh
I will take your hand and
We'll rise up from the dust, oh

Here we go, go, go
Let us heal and grow
You won't be alone
We're unstoppable
Don't be 'fraid to show
What we're going for
This is what we know

Here we come back to life, we're still breathing
Standing up, everybody's gonna see it
Oh, all you need to know is that we're holding on
Even if we fall, we will rise up
And we follow the path that we believe in
No, we're not gonna stop until we reach it
Oh, all you need to know is that we're holding on
We'll rise up from the dust and claim our throne
We'll rise up from the dust and claim our throne

We all have our reasons
Why we are on this track, oh
We all have our burdens, yeah, but
We just keep on fighting and we never look back

Here we go, go, go
Let us heal and grow
You won't be alone
We're unstoppable
Don't be 'fraid to show
What we're going for
This is what we know

Here we come back to life, we're still breathing
Standing up, everybody's gonna see it
Oh, all you need to know is that we're holding on
Even if we fall, we will rise up
And we follow the path that we believe in
No, we're not gonna stop until we reach it
Oh, all you need to know is that we're holding on
We'll rise up from the dust and claim our throne
We'll rise up from the dust and claim our throne
We'll rise up from the dust and claim our throne
