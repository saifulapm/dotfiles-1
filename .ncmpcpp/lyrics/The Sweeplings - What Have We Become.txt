This house
Has many rooms
Filled with dust
And pieces of you
Tangled vines
Made their way in
We left the door
Wide open

Ooooh
What have we become
Ooooh
What have we become

Broken glass
Lay on the floor
Shattered by
What we ignored
The garden
Is overgrown
Leaves have browned
Hiding the rows

Ooooh
What have we become
Ooooh
What have we become

The truth behind
These four walls
Becomes clear
When they're gone
Looking in
Feel their stares
Our mistakes
In open air

Ooooooooh
What have we become [x4]
