I am not in love, but I'm open to persuasion
East or west, where's the best for romancing?
With a friend I could smile, but with a lover I could hold my head back
Really laugh, really laugh
Thank you, you took me dancing 'cross the floor, cheek to cheek
But with a lover I could really move, really dance, really dance, really move
If I can feel the sun in my eyes and the rain on my face, why can't I feel
Love and affection, sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication, sing it, sing it
You know that's what I want, love, ooh-whoo, once more with feeling
With friends I still feel so insecure
Little darling I believe you could help me a lot
Just take my hand and take me where you will
No conversation, no wave goodnight
Just give me love, make - chorus
Give me love, give me love... love... ooh
Give me - chorus
Give me love, make love with affection, sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication, sing it, sing it
You know that's what I like, love oo-whoo! Make love with affection
Give me love, gimme gimme gimme gimme love, ooh, give me love, give me love
