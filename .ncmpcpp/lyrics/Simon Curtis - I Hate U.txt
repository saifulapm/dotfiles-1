I hate you
Everything about you
Don't wanna be in love with you no more
Don't wanna be around you
Touch you
F*** you
Don't ever wanna see you come around my door
Don't ever try to touch me again
I loved you so much
Oh baby
But then
Oh

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, ah ah
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, ah ah

I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah

Betrayed me
Played me
Slayed me
Hurt me like I've never been hurt before
Disowned me
Only
For the
Other people you decided that you wanted in your life more
Made your bed now lie in it
And don't wake up you
F***ing B***h

Don't ever try to touch me again
I loved you so much
Oh baby
But then
Oh

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, ah ah
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, ah ah

I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah

Don't ever try to touch me again again
Don't ever try to touch me again
I hate you
Everything about you
Don't wanna be in love with you no more
I hate you
Everything about you
Don't wanna be in love with you no more

I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
I hate you ah, I hate you ah, I hate you ah, ah
