Dropping bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hits you all at once
I'm already tired and it's the morning
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughing
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darling, I have to cut you off

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

You say you've regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human, oh

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

No way, no way you're human
