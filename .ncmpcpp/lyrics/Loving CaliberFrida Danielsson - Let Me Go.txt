Let me go, go, let me go, go, let me go

I told you I'm not yours anymore
No I'm not yours
So why are you trying to hold on
To hold on when I'm not there for you
Wanna take a different lane
Wanna play my own game
And I don't need you here
So won't you let me go
Wanna take this ball and chain

That you have put on me
And throw it out the window
I think that you should let go
Cause' you know this is not meant to be

Let go
Maybe I should have known
That you are not the right one for me
Let go
I should have known, I should have known
You are not right for me so let go
So let me go, so let me go
You are not right for me so let go
6X Let me go-go

Don't call me I don't wanna talk to you
I'm better of not talking to you
But why are you trying to hold on
To hold on, to hold on
Wanna take a different lane
Wanna play my own game
And I don't need you here
So won't you let me go
Wanna take this ball and chain

That you have put on me
And throw it out the window
I think that you should let go
Cause' you know this is not meant to be

Let go
Maybe I should have known
That you are not the right one for me
Let go
I should have known, I should have known
You are not right for me so let go
So let me go, so let me go
You are not right for me so let go
6X Let me go-go

I told you I'm not yours
So why are you trying to hold on
I think that you should let go
Cause' you know this is not meant to be

Let go
Maybe I should have known
That you are not the right one for me
Let go
I think that you should let go
Cause' you know this is not meant to be
Let go

Maybe I should have known
That you are not the right one for me
You are not right for me so let go
