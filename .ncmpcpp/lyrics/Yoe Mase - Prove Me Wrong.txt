We're going out
We're going out with a boom
You told me "Honey, I don't got any money to use"
I said "Listen, I got no deadlines for me"
I swear I'm gonna make it as long as I keep taking the heat

Did I ever really matter to you?
You're the best, but not my cure
And I swear I could see right through you
I say "yeah", but I'm not sure
Let's burn in a blaze of glory
Let's put it out in a field of snow
You told me it's not my story
But I feel you wanna go

Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go
Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go

You said it was a struggle
You said it wasn't easy to give
But it wasn't getting smarter
It was getting so much harder to live
I know you never wanted to stay in somewhere haunted again
I know in my heart, I never thought you'd abandon a friend

Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go
Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go

Say you won't go

Did I ever really matter to you?
You're the best, but not my cure
And I swear I could see right through you
I say "yeah", but I'm not sure
Let's burn in a blaze of glory
Let's put it out in a field of snow
You told me it's not my story
But I feel you wanna go

Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go
Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go
Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go
Oh prove me wrong
Oh prove me wrong
Say you won't go
