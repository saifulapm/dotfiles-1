We are forever as one in what remains
You're in my blood from the cradle to the grave
I don't like to think about the pieces
Or the cracks and the breaks that still remain
If I could breathe, I'd ask you

So look in my mercy mirror
I need you more than I have known
So look in my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
I'm not ready to let you go

My heart like a planet the sun forgot
Where now? Orbiting the light that I had lost
More than words is silence teaches
How to see and to feel what is real
When sunlight reaches my soul?

So look in my mercy mirror
I need you more than I have known
So look in my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go

It's a wicked game life plays
How it gives and takes away
No turning 'round, touching ground
What we had was so much more than I realized
If I could, I'd embrace, embrace you

And look in my mercy mirror
I need you more than I have known
So look in my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
I'm not ready to let you go
