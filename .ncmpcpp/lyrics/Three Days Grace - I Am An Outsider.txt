I'm on the outside looking through
I know I'm not the same as you
I'd rather be faceless and ignored
Than being the in-crowd desperate for
A way to fit in just a little more (Oh)

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I'm an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now

I don't wanna be any part of your scene (Oh)
I don't believe what you believe (Oh)
I'd rather be faceless in the dark
Than be so fake like the way you are
Yeah that's why I stay so far
Away from you

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I'm an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now

There comes a time we draw the line
Decide we're better off on the outside
Better off on the outside (Whoa)
There comes a time we draw the line
Decide we're better off on the outside (Oh, oh)

I am an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
Better off on my own now
I'm an outsider
I don't care about the in-crowd, no
I'm better off on my own now
