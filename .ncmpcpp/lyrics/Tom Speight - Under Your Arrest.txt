I'd run as fast as I can
I'd hold your hand wherever you may stand
Just to hear your voice beating on my chest
Oh, under your arrest
Oh, under your arrest

I'd fall as hard as I can
I'd follow wherever you may land
Let you keep me back
To keep me at my best
Oh, under your arrest
Oh, under your arrest

There's no refuge for you and I
To keep us bound tight
I can't promise not to make you cry
Or let you down
'Cause I've been here before you know
I know your heart
And I know your soul
We can spend your time going round and round
But I just know I'll let you down

I'd run as fast as I can
I'd hold your hand wherever you may stand
Just to hear your voice beating on my chest
Oh, under your arrest
Oh, under your arrest

There's no refuge for you and I
To keep us bound tight
I can't promise not to make you cry
Or let you down
'Cause I've been here before you know
I know your heart
And I know your soul
We can spend your time going round and round
But I just know I'll let you down

Ohhhhh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhhh-oh-oh-oh
