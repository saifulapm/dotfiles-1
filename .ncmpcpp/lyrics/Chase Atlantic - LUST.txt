Long walk through the forest, come and find me
Cold nights, dark sprites, sipping lightly
I don't even wanna fuck, I just like you
I thought I only liked drugs, I'm surprised too

Walk with me
I'm looking for honesty
Is that your boyfriend, he was watching again, girl think that he's onto me
That doesn't bother me
I deal with this constantly
If he's got a problem then tell that lil' bitch to come over and talk to me

I'm almost too high for this
I see your paranoia, I know it's scandalous
Take a little dip of the candy
You were supposed to get married
See, you were supposed to-

Hard drugs
No trust
Fuck love we can do this shit forever if it's lust yeah
Listen up yeah

Who cares?
I give up
I don't care if they don't like me, listen
I don't give a fuck yeah
I'll be falling in lust

See I been rolling like a ball for a week
With my friends on the Benz
Lockjaw for me, yuh
I pray the medication slow me down
But that shit doesn't work when you're around

I get nervous
Like is it worth it?
I know I'm fucking up his life, it's on purpose
He doesn't deserve it
I can see it in your eyes, you're the kind who'd let the flames take your life away

Hard drugs
No trust
Fuck love we can do this shit forever if it's lust yeah
Listen up yeah
Who cares?
I give up
I don't care if they don't like me, listen
I don't give a fuck yeah
I'll be falling in lust
