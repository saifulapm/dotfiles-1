Depressed again
Morning comes too fast and I'm tired of the routine
Depressed again
Let me sit alone in the tone of tranquility
Angry again
No, I don't wanna have a conversation with you
Angry again
Let me sit alone with the kerosene

I don't even care about you
I don't even care about you

Depressed again
Evening comes too fast, still tired of the routine
Depressed again
I can do without all your false curiosities
Angry again
No, I don't wanna have a conversation with you
Angry again
Let me sit alone with the kerosene

I don't even care about you
I don't even care about you
I don't even care about you
I don't even care about you
