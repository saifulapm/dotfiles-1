(Need you, tell me)
(Need you, tell me)

Panic on the brain, world has gone insane
Things are starting to get heavy
I can't help but think I haven't felt this way
Since I asked you to go steady

Wondering
Would you be, my little quarantine?
Or is this the way it ends?

'Cause I told you, my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my, level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

Panic on the brain, Michael's gone insane
Julie starts to make you nervous
I don't really care what they would say
I'm asking you to stay
In my bunker underneath the surface

Wondering
Would you be, my little quarantine?
Or is this the way it ends?

'Cause I told you, my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my, level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Bring down my, level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

'Cause I told you, my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
You could bring down my, level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

I need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
I need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

Need you now
I need you now

'Cause I told you, my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
You could bring down my, level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
Tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay
You could bring down my, level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay

In a world, where you could just lie to me
And I'd be okay
We'll be okay
We're gonna be okay

(My level of concern)
(Just need you to tell me we're alright, tell me we're okay)
I need you

(Need you, tell me)
(Need you, tell me)
