All this time
You thought you had me down
Sure you had snuffed me out
Undermined
You made me come undone
I was your smoking gun

You'd hold me (you'd hold me)
Control me (control me)
You stole me (you stole me)
Your plan almost broke me
Ashes (ashes)
Remind me (remind me)
Just who am I

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
Burning down your empire (empire, empire)
Glowing brighter than the darkness inside of you
Can't escape the flame no matter what you do
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)

Lost the fight
You're not the chosen one
But you'll miss me when I'm gone
Reignite
You lost your grip on me
And now I blaze wild and free

You'd hold me (you'd hold me)
Control me (control me)
You stole me (you stole me)
Your plan almost broke me
Ashes (ashes)
Remind me (remind me)
Just who am I

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
Burning down your empire (empire, empire)
Glowing brighter than the darkness inside of you
Can't escape the flame no matter what you do
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)

Ashes (ashes)
Remind me (remind me)...

I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
Burning down your empire (empire, empire)
Glowing brighter than the darkness inside of you
Can't escape the flame no matter what you do
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
'Bout to start a wildfire (wildfire, wildfire)
I am ember
