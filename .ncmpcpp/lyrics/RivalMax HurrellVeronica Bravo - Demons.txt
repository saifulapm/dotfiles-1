[Verse 1]
Life's a pill that’s hard to swallow
All my demons scream the echos
And I'm cleaning blood off a bathroom wall
A fractured heart and a shattered soul
Lays there next to hers

[Chorus]
Are you alive or just breathing?
Is it living when your dreaming?
I'll be gone
And karma will leave a note
Are you alive or just breathing?
Does god know it when you’re kneeling?
Cause when I'm gone
When I'm gone
I hope you can see ghosts

[Verse 2]
Dead asleep you're seeing shadows
Revenge is awake under your pillow
I sense your fear crawling down your back
I'm the haunting past in a shade of black
I lay there next to her

[Chorus]
Are you alive or just breathing?
Is it living when your dreaming?
I'll be gone
And karma will leave a note
Are you alive or just breathing?
Does god know it when you're kneeling?
Cause when I'm gone �When I’m gone
I hope you can see ghosts

[Bridge ?]
You made up all my darkest days
You’re the one that left me wide awake
I'm not afraid anymore
I’m just a sense in your core
You can take back all my darkest days
You're the only one that's worth the pain
I'm not afraid anymore
Oh I hope
I hope you can  see ghosts

[Outro ?]
You made up all my darkest days
You’re the one that left me wide awake
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm just a sense in your core
You can take back all my darkest days
You're the only one that's worth the pain
I'm not afraid anymore
Oh I hope
I hope you can  see ghosts
