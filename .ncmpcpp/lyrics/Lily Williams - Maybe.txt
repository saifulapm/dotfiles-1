Girl, you know I love you
No matter what you do
And I hope you understand me
Every word I say is true, 'cause I love you'

Baby, I'm thinkin' of you
Tryin' to be more of a man for you
And I don't have much of riches
But we gonna see it through, 'cause I love you

Some men need lots of women
For their passions to feel
But I want only you, girl
If it's in, if it's in, if it's in Lord's will, 'cause I, 'cause I love you

I, I, I love you, baby
With all my heart and soul, oh, oh, oh

I love you
I need you
I want you
I need you

Oh, oh, oh, your love makes me grow stronger
It keeps goin' on, oh, baby, I'm glad I found you
I just love to be around you, oh, baby
You've been so good to me, oh, baby, oh, oh, oh

You know, one time things got so bad until
I had to go to one of my friends and talk to him
And I told him, I said, "You know
I'm having problems with the woman that I love

It seems that I call her on the phone and I, I just can't get her to answer
And then I went to her house and I saw a car parked in the driveway
I knocked on the door, but still my knocks went unanswered
And then I went home and I, I watched television until television went off

And then I played my records until I just didn't want to hear them
Anymore and finally I went to bed
But I found myself waking up a few hours later
And the tears were running down my face" And my friend told me

He said, "Lenny, you just oughta forget about her"
But I told my friend, I said, "You know, maybe you've never been in love
Like I've been in love, and maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt"
But this is what I told my friend

I said, "You know, sometimes you get lonely
You get lonely, you get lonely"
Oh, oh, oh and I cry, I cry
Oh, oh, oh

And the tears would fill up in the wells, in the wells of my eyes, oh baby
And then it got so bad, it got so bad
Till one time I thought I'd roll myself up in a big ol' ball and die
And then I met you, darlin' and you smiled at me

Oh, oh, it was such a pretty smile, yes, it was
And you reached out your hand
You helped me, you helped me, you helped, oh
I'm glad, baby, I'm glad, baby, oh, oh, oh, baby

I won't ever leave you, baby, I won't ever grieve you, baby
I'm gonna love you, oh, oh, oh, baby
I'm glad, I'm glad, baby
Oh, oh, yeah, baby, oh, oh, oh

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, oh
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you
I love you
