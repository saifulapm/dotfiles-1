You've seen their nightmares come alive
You've seen their sweetest dreams blossom and die
You've seen it all before, you've seen it all
So why do you build us up to crumble and fall?
Why do you build us up to crumble and fall?

Give me strength and gratitude
Tell me what it is I can ask of you
Tell me what it is that I can't see
Tell me now, oh, tell me now who is it I'm supposed to be

You've given us a glimpse of paradise
You've given us a glimpse of what will be our sweet demise
You've given us everything and nothing at all
So why do you build us up to crumble and fall?

Give me strength and gratitude
Tell me what it is I can ask of you
Tell me what it is that I can't see
Tell me now, oh, tell me now who is it I'm supposed to be

Something is wrong with me, can't make up my mind
I'm falling apart at the seams, I can't deny
I'm losing grip of what I thought I knew
Oh I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you

Give me strength and gratitude
Tell me what it is I can ask of you
Tell me what it is that I can't see
Tell me now, oh, tell me now who is it I'm supposed to be

Something is wrong with me can't make up my mind
Something is wrong with me
