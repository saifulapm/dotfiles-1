Don’t speak
Quiet please
I’m Dreaming – Peacefully
Lets not breathe – at all
Got a long way to go

To go – go – to go –to go- to go
Bells ring
Out across the skies
A warning that my dreams have come to life
If I ignore
I’ll have a long way to go

To go – go – to go –to go- to go
(Hold on tightly- stay close by me)
