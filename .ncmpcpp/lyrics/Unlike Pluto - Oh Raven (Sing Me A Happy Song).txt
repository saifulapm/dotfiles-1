Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song

Here you are again
Bad news from a bad friend
They call you an omen
Only here to torment
Wicked and Hellbent
A damned soul pretending
But I don't believe them
Oh oh oh

You don't want me to stay alone
That's why you gotta sing your song
You keep tapping at my door
Nevermore nevermore nevermore

But can I ask you something
A favor from you my friend
This song you keep singin'
Nevermore nevermore nevermore

Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song

Raven can you hear me
Thought you loved me but you fooled me
You drove me to madness
No one here to witness

Vicious and relentless
A villain in a black dress
Too late I should have listened
Oh oh oh

You want me to be alone
Remind me of what is gone
Singing from dusk till dawn
Nevermore nevermore nevermore

A question before I go
A favor from you my foe
This song you keep singin'
Nevermore nevermore nevermore

Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song

Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
Scorpion sting, I don't wanna bleed
Tell me that I'm not lost
Oh Raven won't you sing me a happy song
