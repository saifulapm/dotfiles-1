I'm feeling kind of pressured
I feel it tonight
The feeling that I've got to set the party off right
The pressure makes it better
I've said it before
I give in to the music
But the music wants more

Time to feel the beat in my skin
The people keep on begging me to give in
To the way that they wanna move
Too many people trying to tell you what to do

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Just gonna keep on doing my thing
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I play it
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance

Just give up the illusion
That you're going to win
There will be no confusion
Cause you're gonna give in
I see your body moving
It can't be ignored
You move a little harder
But I think I want more

Time to feel the beat in my skin
The people keep on begging me to give in
To the way that they wanna move
Too many people trying to tell you what to do

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Just gonna keep on doing my thing
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I play it
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance

This is not an apology
Just some reverse psychology
Cause if I tell you not to do something
Then I can guarantee

You'll do it

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Keep on doing my thing (my thing)
(Over, over, over, over)
I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Gonna keep on doing my thing (my thing)
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I'm playing
Don't dance

I'm not gonna tell you to dance
Just gonna keep on doing my thing (my thing)
I'm not gonna tell you to move
Just gonna keep on playing the way I'm playing
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
Don't dance, don't dance, don't dance, don't dance
