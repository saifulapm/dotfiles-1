I wish everything was simple
I wish all I had to do
Is wonder all loves unsolved riddles
Believe in you

I wish everyone was happy
I wish all I had to say
When you're the only one left standing at the dance that
It'll be ok

I wish people prayed
For heaven here today
No one needs to wait
Know no fear or hate

I wish God would write me letters
And tell me all He meant to mean
Or introduce me to love's author
When my eyes don't see

And she could take me through the lessons
And I could trade some songs I wrote
And though most the days I'd say we're just guessing
It's enough to hold

I wish people's hope
Buried deep would grow
Underneath old roads
Break green leaves through stone

I wish everything was simple
I wish everyone would stay
But if it's all a long-drawn circle
You can go away

And I might see you in a smile
And I might hear you in a laugh
I might meet you in a while
Until then, it's a simple dream we had
