You're the sound of a song and I can't get you out of my head
You're the calm in the storm
You're the voice saying come back to bed
Maybe I'm just too tired to keep running
Maybe you're what I never saw coming

Am I in your head half as often as you're on my mind?
If I don't make sense, please forgive me, I can't sleep at night
At least not alone, not anymore
Not since I found what I never went looking for
And now you're in my head
I must've lost my mind

You're the scars on my skin
You're the past I don't wanna erase
You're the words on my lips that have left
But I still seem to taste
Maybe I'm just too tired to keep lying
Maybe you're all I ever wanted

Am I in your head half as often as you're on my mind?
If I don't make sense, please forgive me, I can't sleep at night
At least not alone, not anymore
Not since I found what I never went looking for
And now you're in my head
I must've lost my mind

There's an empty space beside me
And I'll keep it that way until you're here
I need you here
There was another face beside me, but I sent it away
Cause you're not here
Here

Am I in your head half as often as you're on my mind?
If I don't make sense, please forgive me, I can't sleep at night
At least not alone...
