Løv Li - I Miss You

Jet planes in the night sky with you
Getting high in the sunrise with you
Getting through all the bad times with you
I wasn't missing a thing now I do

And I wish that I could build a time machine
Cuz time moves on
And now you're gone

Oh if only I could build a time machine
I'd come and get you
I can't forget you

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you all the time

I wish that
I wish that
Wish that you were mine

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you all the time

I wish that
I wish that
Wish that you were mine

(...)

What the hell am I doing this for
Laying here on my bedroom floor
Finding peace in the memories of you
I wasn't missing a thing now I do

And I wish that I could build a time machine
Cuz time moves on
And now you're gone

Oh if only I could build a time machine
I'd come and get you
I can't forget you

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you all the time

I wish that
I wish that
Wish that you were mine

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you all the time

I wish that
I wish that
Wish that you were mine
