You tell me that I'm acting different
You tell me that something is missing
I've got a couple drunk kisses
I still need to get out my system

You the type I wanna spend my whole life with
But not the one I'll spend tonight with
We're just in two different places
You've gotta face it

I wanna be young and party
Be dumb and never feel sorry
Become a freak with my body
I wanna be young and party
I'm tired of taking my phone out
Tell you I'm not coming home now

I think I could love you forever
And ever and ever and ever
But don't think we should be together
together together right now

I think I could love you forever
And ever and ever and ever
As long as forever and ever and ever and ever
Don't start right now

You know I think that you're perfect
But I know why it's not working
You've always had the worst timing
And I've had a thing for all-nighters
Drinking and smoking and kissing my friends
I wake up and do it again
I say that I'm guilty and do it again again again again

I wanna be young and party
Be dumb and never feel sorry
Become a freak with my body
I wanna be young and party
I'm tired of taking my phone out
Tell you I'm not coming home now

I think I could love you forever
And ever and ever and ever (Uh)
But don't think we should be together, together, together
Right now

I think I could love you forever
And ever and ever and ever
As long forever and ever
And ever and ever and ever don't start right now

Oh, if I could love you, then I would love you
I'm letting go and even though it hurts, ah
If I could love you, then God I want to
But think I need to learn to love me first

I wanna be young and party
Be dumb and never feel sorry
Become a freak with my body
I wanna be young and party
I'm tired of taking my phone out
Tell you I'm not coming home now

I think I could love you forever
And ever and ever and ever (Uh)
But don't think we should be together
I think I could love you forever (And ever and ever and ever)
But don't think we should be together
(Together, together) right now
I think I could love you forever
(And ever and ever and ever)
As long forever and ever and ever
and ever and ever don't start right now
