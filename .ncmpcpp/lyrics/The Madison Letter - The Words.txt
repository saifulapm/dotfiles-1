You got blood on your hands, how do you plead?
Boy, it's like treason how you treating me
It's eight Mondays in a row (Row)
Nine days of the week (Week)
These tantrums been old (Old)
All bitter, no sweet

You're killing my vibe
In ways words cannot describe
But I'll try, I'll try

You put the "over" in lover, put the "ex" in next
Ain't no "I" in trouble, just the "U" since we met
'Cause you're toxic, boy
I ain't even gotta try to find the
G-O-O-D in goodbye
You put the "over" in lover, put the "ex" in next
Ain't no "I" in trouble, just the "U" since we met
'Cause you're toxic, boy
I ain't even gotta try to find the
G-O-O-D in goodbye

I would take a bullet for you just to prove my love
Only to find out you are the one holding the gun
I'm just tryna get focused
Take some time for me
People started to notice all the shit you couldn't see

You put the "over" in lover, put the "ex" in next
Ain't no "I" in trouble, just the "U" since we met
'Cause you're toxic, boy
I ain't even gotta try to find the
G-O-O-D in goodbye
You put the "over" in lover, put the "ex" in next
Ain't no "I" in trouble, just the "U" since we met
'Cause you're toxic, boy
I ain't even gotta try to find the
G-O-O-D in goodbye

You're killing my vibe
In ways words cannot describe
But I'll try, I'll try

You put the "over" in lover, put the "ex" in next
Ain't no "I" in trouble, just the "U" since we met
'Cause you're toxic, boy
I ain't even gotta try to find the
G-O-O-D in goodbye
