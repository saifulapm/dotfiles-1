I could never watch you go
Now I'm fumbling
Wonder if I let you know
Would you let me in
I don't wanna wait no more
To take hold of it
Know I've never been so sure
Been so sure [x2]

Oh I know that this could hurt, this could hurt
Lay it on the line and watch me burn

So light me up
There's a rhythm in your heart tonight
It beats enough for you and I to come alive
Come alive
See you even when I close my eyes
Like a spark in the dead of night
You ignite, you ignite, you ignite me [x3]

Even when the tide is low
You pull me in
Never been so comfortable
Inside your skin

Oh the point of no return
Lay it on the line, watch me burn

So light me up
There's a rhythm in your heart tonight
It beats enough for you and I to come alive
Come alive
See you even when I close my eyes
Like a spark in the dead of night
You ignite, you ignite, you ignite me [x3]

I wish that you were closer
I wish that I was sober
Don't want it to be over
I wish that you would love me back

I wish that we were closer
I wish that I was sober
Don't tell me that it's over
I wish I didn't want you bad

So light me up
There's a rhythm in your heart tonight
It beats enough for you and I to come alive
Come alive
See you even when I close my eyes
Like a spark in the dead of night
You ignite, you ignite, you ignite me [x3]
