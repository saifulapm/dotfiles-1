I got this cold White Russian in my hand
I got this turquoise sky and zero plans
I got this car full of smoke and gasoline
Letting my mind unwind in my own jet stream
I'd love someone like you to come along for a ride
If you got nothing to do for the rest of the night

Girl I got this
Don't got to think too hard
It's a can't miss
I know right where to start
Yeah the only thing I'm needin' is a girl to play the lead
In this cool movie that I'm dreaming of right now
And if you're down with that
I got this
Yeah I got this

I got this red sombrero and some Black and Milds
I got this pile of vinyl records coming back in style
You put the happy in my hello
Make my sun a brighter yellow
Just say hello to that halo
Girl and just let yourself just let go

'Cause I got this
Don't got to think too hard
It's a can't miss
I know right where to start
Yeah the only thing I'm needin' is a girl to play the lead
In this cool movie that I'm dreaming of right now
And if you're down with that
I got this
Yeah I got this

I got this tailwind taking me into town
You got this work week that you wanna drown
We got a full moon fever on a hot country night
Got this Gibson tuned to half-step down just right

That's right I got this
Don't got to think too hard
It's a can't miss
I know right where to start
Yeah the only thing I'm needin' is a girl to play the lead
In this cool movie that I'm dreaming of right now
And if you're down with that
I got this
Yeah I got this
I got this
Yeah girl I got this
