I was the one who wanted nothing
I was the one who lived in pain
I was the one who strived for nothing
1 was the one who stood in rain

I feel like I'm no good I should run away
I feel like failure's one step ahead of me

Fuck all the people with the Bentley's with their nice lives
Fuck all the people in the mansions with their bright skies
Fuck all the people sitting pretty with their sane minds
Fuck, think I'm becoming the villain of my story

I am the one that's holding grudges
I am the one that lives in pain
I am the one who's out of touch and
I am the one inflicting pain

I feel like I'm no good I should run away
I feel like failure's one step ahead of me

Fuck all the people with the Bentley's with their nice lives
Fuck all the people in the mansions with their bright skies
Fuck all the people sitting pretty with their sane minds
Fuck, think I'm becoming the villain of my story

And I've been the bad guy for so long, I'm growing tired
Is it too damn late to twist the plot to turn it round
