You made a mistake
On the day that you met me and lost your way
You saw all the signs
But you let it go
You closed your eyes
I should've told you to leave
Cause I knew all the time you couldn't handle me
But you're hard to resist
When you're on your knees begging me

I tear you down
I make you bleed eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you and it's hurting me
I don't have wings so flying with me won't be easy
Cause I'm not an angel, I'm not an angel

I hate being that wall
That you hit when you feel like you gave it all
I keep taking the blame
When we both know that I'll never change

I tear you down
I make you bleed eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you and it's hurting me
I don't have wings so flying with me won't be easy
Cause I'm not an angel, I'm not an angel

I wasn't always this way
I used to be the one with the halo
But that disappeared when I had my first taste and fell from grace
It left me in this place
Now I'm starting to think maybe you like it

I tear you down
I make you bleed eternally
Can't help myself
From hurting you and it's hurting me
I don't have wings so flying with me won't be easy
Cause I'm not an angel, I'm not an angel

I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel

I'm not an angel
I'm not an angel
