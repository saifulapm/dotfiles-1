I got the sunset in my pocket, and I'm not afraid to use it
Now I'm feelin' superhuman, that's the point of the illusion

Like: I'm the man, I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man on demand 'round here
I'm the man 'round here

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better show me now
Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better show me now
Shots fired on me!
Shots fired on me!
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
Shots fired on me

(Woah-oh)
(Woah-oh)
(Woah-oh)
If you find a change of heart I might forgive you (I might forgive you)
But if you keep running that mouth it just might kill you (Just might kill you)

Cause I'm the man, I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man 'round here
I'm the man on demand 'round here
I'm the man 'round here

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better show me now
Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better show me now
Shots fired on me!
Shots fired on me!
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
Shots fired on me!
Shots fired on me!
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
No, no

(Woah-oh)
(Woah-oh)
(Woah-oh)

Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better show me now
Baby, you can't stomp me out
You know you can't even slow me down
You know I spread this wild around
So if you're sure, you better show me now
Shots fired on me!
Shots fired on me!
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
Shots fired on me!
Shots fired on me!
Can't stomp me out, you can't stomp me out
No, noï»¿
