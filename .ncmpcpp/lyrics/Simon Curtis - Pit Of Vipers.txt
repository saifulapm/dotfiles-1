I can almost feel the tick like clockwork
Hearing all the voices in my head each time I go
There's a game they play that I'm not part of
Tearing at the weaknesses and all the faults they know
It's impossible to navigate around
It's inevitable that you'll fall in
It's improbable I'll ever come back down
I fell in and now I think I might drown

I've fallen deep into a
Pit of vipers
Sliding over me, over me
And I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a
Pit of vipers
S-s-slithering, whispering
Feel the venom poisoning me

Now I must admit that I have played a part
In the way that things have gotten out of hand
But it's escalated almost to an art
I wanna fix it but I don't think I can

I've fallen deep into a
Pit of vipers
Sliding over me, over me
And I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a
Pit of vipers
S-s-slithering, whispering
Feel the venom poisoning me
Slither, slither, slither
Put your fangs into my back
Slither, slither, slither
Think I don't know where you're at

I use you
I'm no good
Need to be in control
I said I use you
I'm no good
Need to be in control

I've fallen deep into a
Pit of vipers
Sliding over me, over me
And I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a
Pit of vipers
S-s-slithering, whispering
Feel the venom poisoning me

I've fallen deep into a
Pit of vipers
Sliding over me, over me
And I can't break free
Secrets run deep when you're in a
Pit of vipers
S-s-slithering, whispering
Feel the venom poisoning me
Slither, slither, slither
Put your fangs into my back
Slither, slither, slither
Think I don't know where you're at

I use you
I'm no good
Need to be in control
I said I use you
I'm no good
Need to be in control

This is how you make me feel
