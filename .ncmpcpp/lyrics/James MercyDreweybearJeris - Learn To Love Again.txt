[Verse 1]
It’s midnight
And we’re fighting our demons
We’re searching for meaning
We’re reaching the point of pain
And when I think I don’t need ya
You pull me in close, and I
Remember how far we came

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s one, two, three a.m
And we can fight all night if that’s the plan
And when we wake back up
We can do it again (ah-ooh-ahh)
It’s one, two, three a.m
And we can fight all night if that’s the plan
And when we wake back up
We can do it again (ah-ooh-ahh)

[Buildup]
Learn to love again, learn to love again
Learn to love again, learn to love again
When we wake up we’ll learn to love again

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun comes up
We can learn to love again
And after we’ve said
Let’s just put this shit to bed
When we wake up we’ll learn to love again

[Verse 2]
It’s too late
You know that we should be sleeping
But we are still bleeding
From the wounds of the evening

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s one, two, three a.m
And we can fight all night if that’s the plan
And when we wake back up
We can do it again (ah-ooh-ahh)

[Buildup]
Learn to love again, learn to love again
Learn to love again, learn to love again
When we wake up we’ll learn to love again

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
When the sun comes up
We can learn to love again
And after we’ve said
Let’s just put this shit to bed
When we wake up we’ll learn to love again

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
When we wake up we’ll learn to love again
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
When we wake up we’ll learn to love again
