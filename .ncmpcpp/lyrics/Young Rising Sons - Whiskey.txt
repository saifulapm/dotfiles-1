I can barely speak, barely hold my head up now
I feel buried in, shadows try and black me out
I've been carrying this bottle but it weighs me down
My addictive personality finally got the best of me
She spun around, tipsy, and and my hands are tied
So I turn to her, told myself it's just a vice
'Cause I know that she's no good, but I am hypnotized
Her lips are a distillery and

She put whiskey, whiskey, whiskey in the water
I try and fight it, but her proof stronger
I'm pinned against the altar, wrestling with the monster
But every time I try to leave, she pours herself into my drink

I can feel the burn on the rocks, it lays me out
But she takes me neat and tells me that I'm all hers now
Never had a sip of royalty, but taste the crown
Her lips are a distillery and

She put whiskey, whiskey, whiskey in the water
I try and fight it, but her proof stronger
I'm pinned against the altar, wrestling with the monster
But every time I try to leave, she pours herself into my drink
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey in the water
With every pull, she pushes even harder
She always seems to know when I start to sober up
And she pours the stuff into my drink
(Whiskey in the water)

Like a shot to the slaughter, but there's blood in the water
The current is dragging, pulling me farther
The more that I fight it, the more it gets stronger
Fighting me, dragging me, pulling me down below
Down below

She put whiskey, whiskey, whiskey in the water
I try and fight it, but her proof stronger
I'm pinned against the altar, wrestling with the monster
But every time I try to leave, she pours herself into my drink
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey in the water
With every pull, she pushes even harder
I'm pinned against the altar, wrestling with the monster
But every time I try to leave, she pours herself into my drink

Whiskey in the water, whiskey in the water
