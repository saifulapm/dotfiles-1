Just a hunk o' steel
Yeah and just a plank o' wood
Give a little bit of bad lu-uck
Mmm, just a bit o' goo-ood

I could be so happy
With this life of mine
But you know I'm so sad baby
So sa-ad, all the ti-i-ime

That's why life baby-why, oh yeah-eah-eah
It's no good without you

Really, now son
Yeah, yeah that's my life baby-why
Mmm, it's no good without you

Let me tell you 'bout it now
I ain't got no money
I can't find no work
I could've been a good man

Mmm-yeah, a good man and not a jerk
If things could've been different
We could'a had some changes made
But you went away child

Lord knows, you should've stay-ay-ayed
That's my life baby-why
Oh-oh yeah-eah-eah, it's no good without you
