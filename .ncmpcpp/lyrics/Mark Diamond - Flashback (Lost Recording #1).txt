Tell me how you do it, how you do it
Tell me how you sleep at night
Familiar faces, desired places
Stuck in my mind

And all the lights go out
I hear you breathing on my neck and now
I'm

Having flashbacks
Life before the impact
You're in my arms
Flashback
Baby, did you feel that?
Am I alone?

Only you and me, just a dream
Pulling me into the night
Now I'm seeing shadows all around me
Won't you tell me I'll be fine?

And all the lights go down
I hear you breathing on my neck and now
I'm

Having flashbacks
Life before the impact
You're in my arms
Flashback
Baby did you feel that?
Am I alone?

I hear your voice now
I feel you on my skin

Is it all real now?
Is this a dream I'm living in?

Tell me how you do it, how you do it, do it

Flashbacks
Life before the impact
You're in my arms
Flashback
Baby did you feel that?
Am I alone?

Flashbacks
Life before the impact
You're in my arms
Flashback
Baby did you feel that?
Am I alone?
