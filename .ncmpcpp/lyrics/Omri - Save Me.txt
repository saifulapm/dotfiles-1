[Chorus]
Save me
You should never break me
You're the thing that makes me
Be afraid of myself
Don't tell me you're sorry
Just say a thing to stop me
Help me break the silence
Come and save me from myself

[Verse 1]
Do me away
It's easy when you
Give the right excuse
But when you stay
You keep me interlaced
With your disuse

[Chorus]
Save me
You should never break me
You're the thing that makes me
Be afraid of myself
Don't tell me you're sorry
Just say a thing to stop me
Help me break the silence
Come and save me from myself (yo)
So, save me
You should never break me
You're the thing that makes me
Be afraid of myself
Don't tell me you're sorry
Just say a thing to stop me
Help me break the silence
Come and save me from myself

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's hard to see the simple truth that's in front of you You say to yourself over and over again that you're doing the right Thing but what if the right thing is following that feeling you have In your gut even if it means losing someone you love

[Verse 2]
Give me a way to reach inside
And find the piece of truth
As I decay
I lose the part of me that wants to fight

[Chorus]
So, save me
You should never break me
You're the thing that makes me
Be afraid of myself
Don't tell me you're sorry
Just say a thing to stop me
Help me break the silence
Come and save me from myself
Come save me
Save me
You should never break me
