Alone in a crowded room
My eyes will search for you
Abandoned by my company
I'll search for what's in front of me
And hope that I find something new

My heart is like the ocean searching
Searching for the shore I'm learning
There must be something more than dreaming

This heart of mine is tired
But my feet will not retire
The alcohol will not suppress
The fear of death and loneliness
I know that I'm not alone

My heart is like the ocean searching
Searching for the shore I'm learning
There must be something more than dreaming

My heart is like the ocean searching
Searching for the shore I'm learning
There must be something more than dreaming

I've wrestled with the truth for quite some time
And I've been drowning in this restless mind
I'm sick of being so unsatisfied
Tell me that the answer's right
God are you awake at night?
'Cause I've been abandoned by my company
I'll search for what's in front of me
And hope that I find something new

My heart is like the ocean searching
Searching for the shore I'm learning
There must be something more than dreaming

My heart is like the ocean searching
Searching for the shore I'm learning
There must be something more than dreaming
