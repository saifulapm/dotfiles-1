Give me two and I'm gone
I get lost, I get lost
Dancing under your rain
Back to me, back to me, yeah

I thought I saw your face on a photograph
Saw you all alone and I had to ask
Why you wanna go? Don't you run so fast
Talk back to me, talk back to me
Movin on me slow and my heart beat fast
Kiss me on the cheek and it hurt so bad
You don't what you do when you move like that
Talk back to me, talk back to me, yeah

Give me two and I'm gone
I get lost, I get lost
Dancing under your rain
Back to me, back to me, yeah
Just give me two and I'm gone
I get lost, I get lost
Dancing under your rain
Back to me, back to me, yeah

Well, I can never tell if it was on like that
Crying on the phone when I made you laugh
All the parking lots where we used to...
Talk back to me, talk back to me
Wishing I was you without a care like that
Baby girl, I thought you knew we had it good like that
Say it to my face and make it fade to black
Back to me, back to me, yeah

Just give me two and I'm gone
I get lost, I get lost
Dancing under your rain
Back to me, back to me, yeah
Give me two and I'm gone
I get lost, I get lost
Dancing under your rain
Back to me, back to me, yeah

Yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
On you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And I-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
On you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I love now, now, now
Ah-oh-oh-oh, back to me, yeah
I, I, I, I, girl, I, I, I want you back
I, I, I want you back, I want you
Talk to me, yeah
