Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream
Make her the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her two lips like roses and clover
And tell her that her lonely nights are over
Sandman
I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream
Make her the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her the word that I'm not a rover
And tell her that her lonely nights are over
Oh Sandman
I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream

Oh Sandman
Bring us a dream
Make her the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her two lips like roses and clover
And tell her that her lonely nights are over
Oh Sandman
I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman
Bring me a dream
Make her the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her two lips like roses and clover
And tell her that her lonely nights are over
