With the summer sun over us
I never thought that I could feel this blind
Remembering how I would give a fuck
Stressing out because I wanted time
Now I'm pouring out an hourglass
Waiting for the wind to carry me
I wish the sun would go and hide away
Cause I've just been dying for rain
And lately, I don't feel the same
Though I've been trying to

I don't know love no more
I don't know love no more
It's easier when you know
You'll be fine on your own

But I don't know love no more
I don't know love no more
You say that you know this road
But you don't know difficult

You will call me when you need it, call it when it's convenient for ya
You don't know the way you control me
Act like you don't see it, spill a ocean of secrets and ya
Hold me down and hope I won't drown 'til

I don't know love no more
And I don't know love no more
It's easier cause I know
I'll be fine on my own

But I don't know love no more
I don't know love no more
You say that you know this road
But you don't know difficult

I don't know love
I don't know love
I don't know love
