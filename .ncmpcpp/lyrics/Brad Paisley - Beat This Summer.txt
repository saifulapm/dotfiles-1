Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ho

Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere (anywhere)

Baby I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna endâ€¦

As long I live, whatever I do (Whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Yeah looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby I can tell

As long I live, whatever I do (Whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
