Eight years old and he's kicking and screaming
"I'll only go to school if you give me a reason
The kids are really mean and I already know all the things they're teaching"
Hopped in the car mama let him play hookey
Missed the first hour just to get a cup of coffee
She's the only one who saw who he was, no one else could read him
Showing up late but he makes it to class
Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back
He daydreamed away to a sky so gray
Everything's simple, it's driving him mental
Wishing every day that something would change
Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay
And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes saying
"Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?"

He does all that he should
Why is he misunderstood?

This is a story bout a broken boy
With his headphones in just to block out the noise
Of everyone around him telling him the way to go
So he walks the world alone
Wondering if it gets better
Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever
So he gets lost tryna find another way back home
As he walks the world alone

Fifteen years and he's drowning his sorrows
Smoking weed, drinking cheap liquor out the bottle
With a bunch of fake friends cuz he tried to fit in but it wasn't working
Ran in with the law bout a dozen of times
Nothing too bad, just a few suburban crimes still
He says to himself, "What are you doing you don't deserve this
Don't you know nobody will ever understand
The person that you are, learn to hold your own hand
Get your shit together and lose the weight
You'll never be what you want, no not with that face"
He started writing all of his thoughts on paper
Realized music made life so much greater
100 pounds down, he looks so different now
As he plans his escape from a crooked hometown

He does all that he should
Why is he misunderstood?

This is a story bout a broken boy

Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever
So he gets lost tryna find another way back home
As he walks the world alone
Alone
Alone

21 years and he's on the right path
But sometimes he wonders if he grew up too fast
And missed out on the little things, all of the little things
(Haha, yeah right)

Who is he kidding, surely not himself
But sometimes he wonders if there's somebody else
Thats takes the same road, but he'll never know
Cuz he walks the world alone

As he walks the world alone
Alone (Does it get better, does it get better)
Alone
As he walks the world alone
Alone
Alone
Yeah he walks the world alone
