Out of the seven billion people in this world, there's only you
Almost a million words that I could say, but none of them will do
So many years that I have lived, but it feels like I've just begun
Out of the seven billion people, baby, you're the only one

I've been too many places. I've seen too many faces
I wrote too many pages; never found a love like you (Love like you)
I don't know how to say it. It's been more than amazing
My whole life, I've been waiting; never found a love like you (Love like you)

Sleep, dream, you, repeat. Live, die next to me
Sleep, dream, you, repeat. Sleep, dream

Out of the seven billion people in this world, there's only you
Almost a million words that I could say, but none of them will do
So many years that I have lived, but it feels like I've just begun
Out of the seven billion people, baby, you're the only one

You were unexpected, when our lips connected
I was resurrected; never found a love like you (love like you)
Don't care where I'm headed when the world is ending
'cause you are my heaven; never found a love like you (love like you)

Sleep, dream, you, repeat. Live, die next to me
Sleep, dream, you, repeat. Sleep, dream

Out of the seven billion people in this world, there's only you
Almost a million words that I could say, but none of them will do
So many years that I have lived, but it feels like I've just begun
Out of the seven billion people, baby, you're the only one

Surrounded by numbers
(Numbers, numbers, numbers)
You're the only one
(Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers)
You're the only one

You brought me back to life
You did the unthinkable
Yeah, you are my miracle

Out of the seven billion people in this world, there's only you
Almost a million words that I could say, but none of them will do
So many years that I have lived, but it feels like I've just begun
Out of the seven billion people, baby, you're the only one

Surrounded by numbers
(Numbers, numbers, numbers)
You're the only one
(Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers)
You're the only one

Surrounded by numbers
(Numbers, numbers, numbers)
You're the only one
(Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers)
You're the only one
