The world was new
The songs ain't true
The thrill of youth
And we were proof

Strobe in rooms and dirty bars
Spending nights inside our cars
We were right inside of it
But we fell, oh well

We reached and burned down places
Back when we were young
Breathe smoke into our faces
Back when we were young

Freshly faded, just emancipated
Too blind to realize
We were changing, move to different places
In time, and all these

Strobe in rooms and dirty bars
Spending nights inside our cars
We were right inside of it
But we fell, oh well

We reached and burned down places
Back when we were young
Breathe smoke into our faces
Back when we were young

We tried to stretch the time
We lost track of the nights
We slept away the days
And hoped we never aging

Strobe in rooms and dirty bars
Spending nights inside our cars
We were right inside of it
But we fell, oh well

We reached and burned down places
Back when we were young
Breathe smoke into our faces
Back when we were young

I know you're taking it
I want to see fire
I know you're taking it far
