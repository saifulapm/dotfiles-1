(Maniac)

You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause

People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac

You just went too far, wrecked your car
Call me crying in the dark
Now you're breaking my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well

People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?

Psychopathic, don't be so dramatic
We had magic, but you made it tragic
Now you're manic, honestly I've had it
Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
