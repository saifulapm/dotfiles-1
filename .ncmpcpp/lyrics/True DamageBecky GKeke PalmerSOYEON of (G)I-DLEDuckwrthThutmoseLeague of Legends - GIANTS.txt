[Soyeon:]
Wonhaneun ge eolgure boyeo
I'm trouble and you're wa-wa-wa-wanting it
(Wa-wa-wanting it)
[Becky G:]
Yeah, yeah

[Thutmose:]
Moving too fast like I'm moving in slow-mo
I'm a God better ask if you don't know
Homie better put your pride aside
I'm a Benz and you're more like a Volvo
Your best stuff looks like my worst, synapses fire and burst
Got the whole crew with me, 'bout to deal damage, you know we ain't average
I ain't gonna say this again
But this is my time better look in my eyes
I'm a genius in disguise, wear my heart on my sleeve
And you forced to oblige to a king in his prime
Everybody get in Line, sit back, watch the stars align
I finesse like my life on the line was a diamond in the rough
And now I shine

[Becky G:]
Ay, no one can stop us they'll try but they won't
Ay, nada nos puede parar, oh, no!

[Keke Palmer:]
We're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
We're running this world, we keeping it turning
We're living like giants, yeah, giants
We're bigger than giants, we're giants
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Soyeon:]
Sleeping giants, sleeping, sleeping giants (Yeah)

[Becky G:]
Shutting it down, been underground now my people all up in this place
Spinning this thing, gold on my ring, royalty up in my veins
I'm loco, think I'm so cold, I stay stunting, ain't no goin' back
Now they ask where QiQi's at, I'm like you can't hang with that

You should quit sleeping on mines
You got your back on recline
When I damage your delicate spine
Please don't act all shy and surprised
They be like (Huh?), they be like
What you mean (Uh), what is your winning scheme? (Woo)
I got a giant team (Guess what?), big as my self esteem
Run it back, run it back, running man (Run it)
They think they go hard I'm like come again (Sheesh)
You run out of time when I'm bustin' in, while you stumbling
I got this blade in my hand for your punishment

[Keke Palmer:]
Oh, we're wide awake now, our eyes are wide open
We're running this world, we keeping it turning
We're living like giants, yeah, giants
We're bigger than giants, we're, giants
