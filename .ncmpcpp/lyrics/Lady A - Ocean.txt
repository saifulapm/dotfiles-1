How can someone stand so damn close
And feel like they're worlds away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?

All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been, why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart, so help me

Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashing in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

Like a lighthouse, I've been shining bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And "I've done it outta love" is not enough
But God, how I wish it was

And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me

Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashing in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

I can let go
From moments in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves

Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashing in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you
