Let's stay in bed, can't we live like this?
Hey let's try something new you might like
You said I only think with my dick
I said I think you just blew my mind
You suit my vibe
Cause all we do is laugh, fuck, and drink wine
You use me, I use you
Then you leave I feel like I
Hate love I don't want it
I prolly sound like a cynic
I wanna make love I don't wanna fall in it
Man, I gotta stop slippin' into love
Like damn

I hate love I don't want it
Said hate love I don't want it
Yeah we on a good thing and it all clicks
I don't wanna get involved with the bullshit
She said hate love I don't want it
She said hate love I don't want it
She said hate love I don't want it
I just seem to like the idea of it

I don't get love songs and poetry
They just all seem corny mostly
Love seems so warm and cozy
Love makes me claustrophobic
Like get this off I'm roasting
Stop holding my hand, let go of me
Yeah I guess I prolly got a few issues
Buncha old stuff I don't wanna get into
Breathe out, breathe in slow
You don't wanna get involved
I don't wanna get involved you said so
Spell it with a kiss, keep it so simple
So let's avoid the drama
And we can probably
Stay up on this bed all safe instead
Because my flaws are lava

I hate love I don't want it
Said hate love I don't want it
Yeah we on a good thing and it all clicks
I don't wanna get involved with the bullshit
She said hate love I don't want it
She said hate love I don't want it
She said hate love I don't want it
I just seem to like the idea of it

Love is sea water, drink it I get thirstier
Ain't a way of me saying more perfecter
Try to clean up my act became dirtier
Try to grow the fuck up became thirtier
It feels like it's a minute since I heard from you
When you gonna visit and try out the new furniture
Gotta brand new bed and the head's sturdier
Guess I shoulda just sent you that text earlier

I just wanna keep your drawers on the floor
I just wanna keep my flaws in the drawer
I just wanna keep your drawers on the floor
I just wanna keep my flaws in the drawer
She said I can't fall in love with you
We both gotta lotta stuff to do
Let's fuck here on the floor let's not get comfortable
I said I think I'm in love with you
Damn

Why do I keep doing that?
I hate that love
I hate that love
But I just get so caught up in that feeling

Love is beautiful, love is sacred
Love is comfort, love is naked
Love is brand new, love is ancient
Love is right now, love is patience
Love is safety, love is dangerous
Love is played out, love is mainstream
Love is basic, love's a complex
Love is nonsense, she said she hates it

I just wanna keep your drawers on the floor
I just wanna keep my flaws in the drawer
I just wanna keep your drawers on the floor
I just wanna keep my flaws in the drawer
She said I can't fall in love with you
We both gotta lotta stuff to do
Let's fuck here on the floor let's not get comfortable
I said I think I'm in love with you
Damn

I hate love I don't want it
Said hate love I don't want it
Yeah we on a good thing and it all clicks
I don't wanna get involved with the bullshit
She said hate love I don't want it
She said hate love I don't want it
She said hate love I don't want it
I just seem to like the idea of it

Hate love
Hate love
Hate love
Hate love, hate love, hate love
Hate love
Hate love
Hate love, hate love, hate love

You don't just want me for me
And I don't want you though
I know you know that I'm using you
I know you're using me too
It's fucked up what we do
It's cool, it's something you get used to
You don't just want me for me
And I don't want you though
I know you know that I'm using you
I know you're using me too
It's fucked up what we do
It's cool, it's something you get used to
